the event had every promise of happiness for her friend
he could not meet her in conversation rational or playful
the woodhouses were first in consequence there
all looked up to them
his spirits required support
poor miss taylor i wish she were here again
my dear how am i to get so far
randalls is such a distance
i could not walk half so far
no papa nobody thought of your walking
we must go in the carriage to be sure
you know we have settled all that already
we talked it all over with mr weston last night
i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else
that was your doing papa
you got hannah that good place
i am very glad i did think of her
he will be able to tell her how we all are
i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk
not at all sir
but you must have found it very damp and dirty
i wish you may not catch cold
look at my shoes
not a speck on them
i wanted them to put off the wedding
by the bye i have not wished you joy
how did you all behave
tis a sad business
i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome
my dearest papa
what a horrible idea
i meant only myself
we always say what we like to one another
the chances are that she must be a gainer
dear emma bears every thing so well said her father
emma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles
mr knightley shook his head at her
her father fondly replied ah
pray do not make any more matches
it is the greatest amusement in the world
mr weston certainly would never marry again
success supposes endeavour
where is your merit
what are you proud of
there is always some talent in it
i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that
only one more papa only for mr elton
that will be a much better thing
it was an unsuitable connexion and did not produce much happiness
a complete change of life became desirable
it was a concern which brought just employment enough
his father had no apprehension of it
i understand it was a very handsome letter indeed
mr woodhouse told me of it
it was indeed a highly prized letter
she would be very glad to stay
mr woodhouse was fond of society in his own way
she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness
harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody
this was all that was generally known of her history
encouragement should be given
the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her
upon such occasions poor mr woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare
an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome
serle understands boiling an egg better than any body
ours are all apple tarts
you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here
i do not advise the custard
i do not think it could disagree with you
the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions
such a friend as mrs weston was out of the question
two such could never be granted
two such she did not want
harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful
harriet had no penetration
she was very fond of singing
he could sing a little himself
she believed he was very clever and understood every thing
she believed every body spoke well of him
his mother and sisters were very fond of him
she was in no hurry at all
you know what you are about
he does not read
and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield
the next question was
what sort of looking man is mr
not handsome not at all handsome
one does not you know after a time
but did you never see him
he has passed you very often
what do you imagine his age to be
only four and twenty
that is too young to settle
his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry
six years hence
dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old
to be sure so it is
but they live very comfortably
yes to be sure i suppose there are
he did not think we ever walked this road
he thought we walked towards randalls most days
so very odd we should happen to meet
well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected
what do you think of him
do you think him so very plain
do not you begin to feel that now
were not you struck
certainly he is not like mr knightley
i see the difference plain enough
but mr knightley is so very fine a man
what say you to mr weston and mr elton
you must see the difference
oh yes there is a great difference
but mr weston is almost an old man
mr weston must be between forty and fifty
which makes his good manners the more valuable
what is passable in youth is detestable in later age
there is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly
but there may be pretty good guessing
will he indeed
that will be very bad
what has he to do with books
she therefore said no more for some time
her next beginning was
they have more gentleness
they might be more safely held up as a pattern
he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late
if he means any thing it must be to please you
do you really think it a bad thing why so
you surprize me
i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure
i can imagine your objection to harriet smith
they will read together
she means it i know
emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family
she was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident
yes said he smiling
we will not despair however
i only name possibilities
her ignorance is hourly flattery
how well she looked last night
but i am a partial old friend
regular features open countenance with a complexion
she is loveliness itself
mr knightley is not she
i think her all you describe
very well i will not plague you any more
i am sure of having their opinions with me
i will keep my ill humour to myself
i have a very sincere interest in emma
i wonder what will become of her
she had no scruple with regard to him
i have done very little
exactly so that is what principally strikes me
so much superadded decision of character
skilful has been the hand
great has been the pleasure i am sure
i never met with a disposition more truly amiable
i have no doubt of it
did you ever have your likeness taken harriet
said she did you ever sit for your picture
no sooner was she out of sight than emma exclaimed
what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be
i would give any money for it
i almost long to attempt her likeness myself
it would be such a delight to have her picture
i know what your drawings are
how could you suppose me ignorant
you know nothing of drawing
don t pretend to be in raptures about mine
pray pray attempt it
she thinks so little of her own beauty
did not you observe her manner of answering me
how completely it meant why should my picture be drawn
yes i observed it i assure you
it was not lost on me
but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded
her many beginnings were displayed
they were both in ecstasies
no great variety of faces for you said emma
i had only my own family to study from
dear mrs weston
always my kindest friend on every occasion
she would sit whenever i asked her
here is my sketch of the fourth who was a baby
he had nestled down his head most conveniently
i am rather proud of little george
the corner of the sofa is very good
she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait
it then occurred to her to employ him in reading
mr elton was only too happy
harriet listened and emma drew in peace
it is the fault of her face that she has them not
do you think so
i cannot agree with you
it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature
i never saw such a likeness in my life
we must allow for the effect of shade you know
certainly not too tall not in the least too tall
proportions fore shortening oh no
it is very pretty said mr woodhouse
so prettily done
just as your drawings always are my dear
look at the tree
any other situation would have been much less in character
i cannot keep my eyes from it
i never saw such a likeness
his gallantry was always on the alert
he could ride to london at any time
what a precious deposit
said he with a tender sigh as he received it
i come in for a pretty good share as a second
half a minute brought it all out
who could have thought it
she was so surprized she did not know what to do
he will connect himself well if he can
will you read the letter
emma was not sorry to be pressed
she read and was surprized
the style of the letter was much above her expectation
or is it too short
it is so with some men
yes i understand the sort of mind
what shall you do
do you mean with regard to this letter
but what are you in doubt of
you must answer it of course and speedily
but what shall i say
dear miss woodhouse do advise me
the letter had much better be all your own
you will express yourself very properly i am sure
ought to refuse him
my dear harriet what do you mean
are you in any doubt as to that
with a little reserve of manner emma continued
you mean to return a favourable answer i collect
what would you advise me to do
i shall not give you any advice harriet
i will have nothing to do with it
this is a point which you must settle with your feelings
but do not imagine that i want to influence you
you must be the best judge of your own happiness
at this moment whom are you thinking of
emma waited the result with impatience but not without strong hopes
at last with some hesitation harriet said
do you think i am right
dear harriet i give myself joy of this
now i am secure of you for ever
you could not have visited me
she cried looking aghast
you would have thrown yourself out of all good society
i must have given you up
dear me how should i ever have borne it
it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more
he must have a pretty good opinion of himself
thank you thank you my own sweet little friend
we will not be parted
oh no and it is but a short letter too
i am quite determined to refuse him
but how shall i do
what shall i say
the business was finished and harriet safe
even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes
now he has got my letter said she softly
i hope he will not mind it so very much
harriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger
harriet slept at hartfield that night
i treat you without ceremony mr knightley
we invalids think we are privileged people
my dear sir do not make a stranger of me
i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter
emma will be happy to entertain you
you cannot do better sir
i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you
you are expecting her again you say this morning
almost every moment
she has been gone longer already than she intended
something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps
highbury gossips tiresome wretches
harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would
he presently added with a smile
a very serious sort i assure you still smiling
who makes you their confidant
he is desperately in love and means to marry her
well well means to make her an offer then
i was very much pleased with all that he said
i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin
he is an excellent young man both as son and brother
i had no hesitation in advising him to marry
this happened the night before last
was not she the whole day with you
then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her
what is the foolish girl about
a man does not imagine any such thing
but what is the meaning of this
harriet smith refuse robert martin
i saw her answer nothing could be clearer
you saw her answer you wrote her answer too
emma this is your doing
you persuaded her to refuse him
by your account he does seem to have had some scruples
it is a pity that they were ever got over
emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you
she is known only as parlour boarder at a common school
i assure you mine are very different
i must think your statement by no means fair
she desired nothing better herself
she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer
she had no sense of superiority then
if she has it now you have given it
you have been no friend to harriet smith emma
i know him well
depend upon it he had encouragement
better be without sense than misapply it as you do
harriet may pick and chuse
no pray let her have time to look about her
vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief
we shall only be making each other more angry
but the case is altered now
nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked
the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words
emma laughed and disclaimed
depend upon it elton will not do
elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally
i have done with match making indeed
i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls
i shall leave off while i am well
he was very much vexed
she was sorry but could not repent
but he hoped he should in time
mr elton was the only one whose assistance she asked
why will not you write one yourself for us mr
the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration
their luxury and ease
united what reverse we have
i have read worse charades
i give you credit for it
this is feeling your way
approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance
may its approval beam in that soft eye
thy ready wit the word will soon supply
an excellent charade indeed
and very much to the purpose
things must come to a crisis soon now
what can it possibly be
do try to find it out miss woodhouse
i never saw any thing so hard
do you think it is a good one
can it be woman
and woman lovely woman reigns alone
can it be neptune
behold him there the monarch of the seas
shark is only one syllable
miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out
mermaids and sharks
my dear harriet what are you thinking of
give me the paper and listen
for miss read miss smith
their luxury and ease
read it in comfort to yourself
harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion
she read the concluding lines and was all flutter and happiness
she could not speak
but she was not wanted to speak
it was enough for her to feel
emma spoke for her
i thought it must be so
its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other
i am very happy
i congratulate you my dear harriet with all my heart
this is a connexion which offers nothing but good
dear miss woodhouse
it is so much beyond any thing i deserve
mr elton who might marry any body
he is so very superior
only think of those sweet verses to miss
it is a certainty
receive it on my judgment
it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected
your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls
the course of true love never did run smooth
and so excellent in the church
when i look back to the first time i saw him
and how beautiful we thought he looked
he was arm in arm with mr
how nicely you talk i love to hear you
you understand every thing
you and mr elton are one as clever as the other
i never read one more to the purpose certainly
i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour
such things in general cannot be too short
harriet was too intent on the lines to hear
the most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind
such sweet lines
miss woodhouse what can we do about that
leave it to me
i am sure i have not got one half so good
but those two lines are
the best of all
granted for private enjoyment and for private enjoyment keep them
it seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity
it will be giving him so much pleasure
do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration
do not let us be too solemn on the business
no i hope i shall not be ridiculous about it
do as you please
woman lovely woman
it is no difficulty to see who you take after
your dear mother was so clever at all those things
if i had but her memory
we copied it from the elegant extracts
kitty a fair but frozen maid
i hope we shall have her here next week
why should there be any change
she will not be surprized papa at least
i do not know my dear
there will not be time for any thing
he sat musing a little while and then said
she and the children might stay very well
isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband
this was too true for contradiction
i am sure she will be pleased with the children
i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john
aye i wonder which she will
poor little dears how glad they will be to come
they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet
i dare say they are sir
i am sure i do not know who is not
john the second is named after his father
and he is a very clever boy indeed
i think their father is too rough with them very often
the children are all fond of him
well i cannot understand it
that is the case with us all papa
one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other
your friend will not take it amiss i hope
of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines
mr elton certainly did not very well know what to say
after this speech he was gone as soon as possible
there go you and your riddle book one of these days
she pondered but could think of nothing
after a mutual silence of some minutes harriet thus began again
so charming as you are
emma laughed and replied
ah so you say but i cannot believe it
i would rather not be tempted
i cannot really change for the better
if i were to marry i must expect to repent it
i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry
but still you will be an old maid
but what shall you do
how shall you employ yourself when you grow old
one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax
these are the sights harriet to do one good
very true said harriet
one can think of nothing else
dear no said her companion
harriet could just answer oh
dear yes before the gentleman joined them
he had been going to call on them
mr elton then turned back to accompany them
i should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration
it must if i were not here
i wish i were anywhere else
if i could but have kept longer away
for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself
it could be protracted no longer
she was then obliged to be finished and make her appearance
the lovers were standing together at one of the windows
mr elton must now be left to himself
she hardly wished to have more leisure for them
she could never see a fault in any of them
the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his
nothing wrong in him escaped her
there he had not always the patience that could have been wished
no none in the least
papa is only speaking his own regret
and do you see her sir tolerably often
asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father
they are very very kind in their visits
mr weston is really as kind as herself
where is the young man
he has not been here yet replied emma
she shewed it to me
i thought it very well done of him indeed
whether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell
he is but young and his uncle perhaps
my dear papa he is three and twenty
you forget how time passes
i remember that perfectly
how very pleasing and proper of him
cried the good hearted mrs john knightley
i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him
she hoped they might now become friends again
she thought it was time to make up
making up indeed would not do
yes said he smiling and reason good
i was sixteen years old when you were born
little emma grow up a better woman than your aunt
be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited
and john how are you
and how tired you must be after your journey
my dear emma suppose we all have a little gruel
i never had much opinion of the sea air
i am sure it almost killed me once
south end is prohibited if you please
good mr perry how is he sir
why pretty well but not quite well
i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere
but then there is not so clever a man any where
and mrs perry and the children how are they
do the children grow
i have a great regard for mr perry
i hope he will be calling soon
he will be so pleased to see my little ones
i hope they are quite well
why pretty well my dear upon the whole
how sorry i am
but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn
perry does not call it altogether a sickly season
nobody is healthy in london nobody can be
it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there
so far off and the air so bad
we are so very airy
my dear it is not like hartfield
middling my dear i cannot compliment you
i think mr john knightley very far from looking well
cried mr john knightley hearing his own name
what will it answer
will not the old prejudice be too strong
that sweet amiable jane fairfax
she would be such a delightful companion for emma
mr woodhouse agreed to it all but added
you will like harriet
emma could not have a better companion than harriet
here was a dangerous opening
it does not bear talking of
after an interval of some minutes however he began with
south end is an unhealthy place
perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end
a fine open sea he says and very pure air
you should have consulted perry
this is just what perry said
it seemed to him a very ill judged measure
perry i want his directions no more than his drugs
they joined company and proceeded together
a sore throat i hope not infectious
i hope not of a putrid infectious sort
has perry seen her
let me entreat you to run no risks
why does not perry see her
what a strange thing love is
it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned
mr elton in love with me what an idea
i think your manners to him encouraging
i speak as a friend emma
he said no more
emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour
emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject
mr perry has been with her as you probably heard
yes i imagined that is i did not
but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness
such a sad loss to our party to day
weather becomes absolutely of no consequence
snows a little i see
christmas weather observed mr elton
this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings
nothing could be pleasanter
i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls
harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party
to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons
we want only two more to be just the right number
what a very great pleasure it will be to you
if they are not put off he cannot stir
i have not the smallest doubt of the issue
i cannot be so sanguine as mr weston
i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing
what a blessing that she never had any children
poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them
emma wished she had been alone with mrs weston
but at present there was nothing more to be said
mr woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing room
i am sorry for it
they are jealous even of his regard for his father
he ought to come said emma
mrs weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa
and she had difficulty in behaving with temper
is this fair mrs
weston judge between us
have not i some right to complain
i am sure of your kind support and aid
every body must have seen the snow coming on
i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight
i am not at all afraid
i should not mind walking half the way
it will be bad enough for the horses
isabella turned to mrs weston for her approbation of the plan
mrs weston could only approve
i am ready if the others are
shall i ring the bell
and the bell was rung and the carriages spoken for
he was afraid they should have a very bad drive
he was afraid poor isabella would not like it
and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind
he did not know what they had best do
but now she would rather it had not happened
it really was so
i am very much astonished mr elton
mr elton this is the most extraordinary conduct
it is impossible for me to doubt any longer
you have made yourself too clear
who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse is near
no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character
i have thought only of you
i protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else
you cannot really seriously doubt it
charming miss woodhouse
allow me to interpret this interesting silence
it confesses that you have long understood me
i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend
i have no thoughts of matrimony at present
he might have doubled his presumption to me but poor harriet
who could have seen through such thick headed nonsense
there was no denying that those brothers had penetration
his professions and his proposals did him no service
there had been no real affection either in his language or manners
she need not trouble herself to pity him
the first error and the worst lay at her door
there i was quite right
emma was most agreeably surprized mr
she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark
harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of
they must encounter each other and make the best of it
mr frank churchill did not come
the acquaintance at present had no charm for her
i do not know why you should say so
it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof
how odd you are
you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage
he cannot want money he cannot want leisure
a little while ago he was at weymouth
this proves that he can leave the churchills
yes sometimes he can
i shall therefore set off to morrow
respect would be added to affection
respect for right conduct is felt by every body
i rather doubt that
then it would not be so strong a sense
oh the difference of situation and habit
his letters disgust me
your feelings are singular
they seem to satisfy every body else
i suspect they do not satisfy mrs weston
can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations
do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself
you seem determined to think ill of him
you will excuse my being so much over powered
i am not prejudiced
she found something else must be done
she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers
the house belonged to people in business
have you upon your honour
said she well that is quite unexpected
do let me hear what she says
have you heard from miss fairfax so lately
i am extremely happy
i hope she is well
you are so kind
my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well
with the help of spectacles
it is such a blessing
jane speaks so distinct
are you expecting miss fairfax here soon
oh yes next week
indeed that must be a very great pleasure
you are very kind
so very good of them to send her the whole way
but they always do you know
oh yes friday or saturday next
that is what she writes about
yes so i imagined
so obliging of you
he is a most amiable charming young man i believe
very true very true indeed
but you see every thing turns out for the best
he is a most charming young man
i am concerned to hear of it
i think they judge wisely
but mrs dixon must be very much disappointed
you are very obliging to say such things but certainly not
there is no comparison between them
miss campbell always was absolutely plain but extremely elegant and amiable
yes that of course
jane caught a bad cold poor thing
she never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us
nobody could nurse her as we should do
it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world
poor jane is ill
but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard
and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded
the marriage of lieut
the evil day was put off
these were her reasons she had no better
there not to be vulgar was distinction and merit
these were charming feelings but not lasting
there was no getting at her real opinion
she was disgustingly was suspiciously reserved
it was all general approbation and smoothness nothing delineated or distinguished
it did her no service however
her caution was thrown away
emma saw its artifice and returned to her first surmises
the like reserve prevailed on other topics
was he handsome
she believed he was reckoned a very fine young man
was he agreeable
he was generally thought so
she believed every body found his manners pleasing
emma could not forgive her
you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music
you left nothing undone
there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are
if any thing you are too attentive
i think you understand me therefore
what arises from discretion must be honoured
you think her diffident
i do not see it
i am disappointed was his only answer
a great pity indeed
my dear papa i sent the whole hind quarter
i knew you would wish it
yes i always like news
he had time only to say
my dear sir how are you this morning
my dear miss woodhouse i come quite over powered
such a beautiful hind quarter of pork
you are too bountiful
have you heard the news
mr elton is going to be married
where could you possibly hear it mr knightley
a miss hawkins of bath
my dear sir you really are too bountiful
here was a sly glance at emma
by his style i should imagine it just settled
mr elton going to be married
said emma as soon as she could speak
he had better not be in a hurry
he seemed to me very well off as he was
we were always glad to see him at hartfield
a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse
this is great news indeed
jane you have never seen mr
who shall answer that question
very true miss woodhouse so she will
miss hawkins i dare say an excellent young woman
jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf
colonel campbell you know is quite our angel
one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance
he has been gone only four weeks
i do not pretend to it
what is before me i see
she knows i would not offend for the world
how does miss smith do
she seems quite recovered now
have you heard from mrs john knightley lately
those dear little children
but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand
one takes up a notion and runs away with it
no far from it certainly plain
i told you he was plain
as for me my judgment is worth nothing
the weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy
this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed
thank you we do indeed
good morning to you my dear sir
mr knightley is coming too
elton and miss hawkins good morning to you
it was now about the time that she was likely to call
miss woodhouse what do you think has happened
which instantly burst forth had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation
i thought i should have fainted
i did not know what to do
dear i was so miserable
i am sure i must have been as white as my gown
dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable
dear i thought it would have been the death of me
and elizabeth too
miss woodhouse do talk to me and make me comfortable again
she was obliged to stop and think
she was not thoroughly comfortable herself
it was folly to be disturbed by it
ambition as well as love had probably been mortified
mr elton returned a very happy man
many vain solicitudes would be prevented many awkwardnesses smoothed by it
it would be almost beginning their life of civility again
of the lady individually emma thought very little
on that article truth seemed attainable
she brought no name no blood no alliance
could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all
she had talked her into love but alas
she was not so easily to be talked out of it
and now poor girl
she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr elton
she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other
small heart had harriet for visiting
harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account
she had seen only mrs martin and the two girls
it was a bad business
her mind was quite sick of mr elton and the martins
the refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary
it was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits
was a question however which did not augur much
the clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall
i am sure they will bring him soon
he had reached randalls the evening before
i remembered what i used to do myself
his manner had no air of study or exaggeration
their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance
she blessed the favouring blindness
do you know any family of that name
call upon her by all means
go to day go to day
do not defer it
what is right to be done cannot be done too soon
if you do not call early it will be a slight
the son looked convinced
the next morning brought mr frank churchill again
they walked thither directly
if he were deficient there nothing should make amends for it
but on seeing them together she became perfectly satisfied
some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings
he was immediately interested
no it was long enough broad enough handsome enough
it would hold the very number for comfort
it was but an effusion of lively spirits
the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before
and how did you think miss fairfax looking
did you see her often at weymouth
were you often in the same society
i must buy something at ford s
yes gloves and every thing
i do admire your patriotism
you will be adored in highbury
do not let me lose it
you answer as discreetly as she could do herself
i met her frequently at weymouth
i like them all
yes rather hesitatingly i believe i do
i will move a little farther off
he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment
you forget how much she belongs to highbury
said emma highly amused mr
dixon is very musical is he
how did miss campbell appear to like it
it was her very particular friend you know
said emma laughing
well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland
she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction
as to that i do not
i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly
but we never did
it is a most repulsive quality indeed said he
oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing
there is safety in reserve but no attraction
one cannot love a reserved person
intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question
his ideas seemed more moderate his feelings warmer
there must be ample room in it for every real comfort
the man must be a blockhead who wanted more
just the trifling silly fellow i took him for
harriet was to be there in the evening and the bateses
might not the evening end in a dance
had been a question of his
he was soon pretty well resigned
no more is emma
late hours do not agree with us
the ladies knew better how to allay it
mr weston must be quiet and every thing deliberately arranged
he should be happy to see mrs goddard
james could take the note
but you will do every thing right
i need not tell you what is to be done
i shall have no fears for you with him
you will not like staying late
you will get very tired when tea is over
no my love but you will soon be tired
there will be a great many people talking at once
you will not like the noise
the sooner every party breaks up the better
i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain
i know what worthy people they are
perry tells me that mr cole never touches malt liquor
my dear emma we must consider this
you will not regard being tired
you will be perfectly safe you know among your friends
i am only afraid of your sitting up for me
you must promise me not to sit up
if he were he would have done this differently
yes i should i am sure i should
you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed
you are not striving to look taller than any body else
was his reply but not at all in anger
she listened and found it well worth listening to
they might chuse to surprize her
this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure
why do you smile
nay why do you
i rather wonder that it was never made before
perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before
if colonel campbell is not the person who can be
what do you say to mrs
i had not thought of mrs dixon
it is mrs dixon i dare say
i told you that your suspicions would guide mine
dixon very well
and then he saved her life
i was there one of the party
the conversation was here interrupted
the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me
no i am sure it is not from the campbells
indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced
your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely
there was no occasion to press the matter farther
the conviction seemed real he looked as if he felt it
emma divined what every body present must be thinking
she was his object and every body must perceive it
emma restrained her indignation and only turned from her in silence
his importance at enscombe was very evident
this had happened the year before
i never knew days fly so fast
what is the matter
thank you for rousing me he replied
my dear emma i am longing to talk to you
do you know how miss bates and her niece came here
how they were invited were not they
they walked i conclude
how else could they come
she was as grateful as possible you may be sure
nobody was ever so fortunate as herself
very likely said emma nothing more likely
the more i think of it the more probable it appears
mr knightley and jane fairfax
no no henry must have donwell
i am amazed that you should think of such a thing
and jane fairfax too of all women
but the imprudence of such a match
i am not speaking of its prudence merely its probability
no no every feeling revolts
imprudent if you please but not mad
but mr knightley does not want to marry
i am sure he has not the least idea of it
do not put it into his head
he does not care about jane fairfax
in the way of love i am sure he does not
for shame emma
do not mimic her
you divert me against my conscience
little things do not irritate him
i cannot help suspecting him
mr knightley does nothing mysteriously
there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma
i have a very strong notion that it comes from him
frank churchill sang again
she could see nothing but evil in it
knightley must never marry
little henry must remain the heir of donwell
they talked at first only of the performance
surprizes are foolish things
the pleasure is not enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable
i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell
another song however was soon begged for
the strength of the song falls on the second
mr knightley grew angry
this must not be
go and interfere
they have no mercy on her
this would be a trial
he was no dancer in general
there was no immediate appearance
they were a couple worth looking at
two dances unfortunately were all that could be allowed
emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles
if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax
don t class us together harriet
dear i think you play the best of the two
i think you play quite as well as she does
i am sure i had much rather hear you
every body last night said how well you played
but jane fairfax has them both harriet
nobody talked about it
how did you think the coxes looked
just as they always do very vulgar
they talked a great deal about him especially anne cox
she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there
he sat by her at dinner
she looked down the randalls road
i was not aware of it myself
mrs weston was disappointed
i thought you meant to go with me
they would be very much pleased
i should be quite in the way
but perhaps i may be equally in the way here
miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me
my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping
what am i to do
i shall be no support to mrs weston
she might do very well by herself
it need not detain us long
we will go to hartfield afterwards
we will follow them to hartfield
i really wish you to call with me
it will be felt so great an attention
and i always thought you meant it
only my pattern gown is at hartfield
no you shall send it to hartfield if you please
but indeed i would much rather have it only in one
what do you advise
to hartfield if you please mrs
i hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are
very well i am much obliged to you
woodhouse i am so glad to hear such a good account
mrs weston told me you were here oh
we have apple dumplings however very often
patty makes an excellent apple dumpling
how do you do mrs ford
i beg your pardon
i did not see you before
i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town
jane came back delighted yesterday
what was i talking of
said she beginning again when they were all in the street
so very obliging of mr frank churchill
which you know shewed him to be so very
i do congratulate you mrs weston most warmly
he seems every thing the fondest parent could
said he i can fasten the rivet
i like a job of that sort excessively
i never shall forget his manner
that you know was so very
my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days
william larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year
william larkins is such an old acquaintance
i am always glad to see him
and so patty told me and i was excessively shocked indeed
he would be so very
miss smith pray take care
miss smith the step at the turning
said mrs weston have not you finished it yet
you see we have been wedging one leg with paper
this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come
i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home
do not you think so
jane did not look round
she was not obliged to hear
mrs weston had been speaking to her at the same moment
do not distress her
soon afterwards he began again
she could not but hear she could not avoid answering
it must be all conjecture
there it is done
here is something quite new to me
that from such a quarter one might expect
this was all sent with the instrument
nothing hastily done nothing incomplete
true affection only could have prompted it
you speak too plain
she must understand you
i hope she does
i would have her understand me
i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning
i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways
leave shame to her
if she does wrong she ought to feel it
she is not entirely without it i think
i do not see much sign of it
so obliged to you for the carriage last night
we were just in time my mother just ready for us
pray come in do come in
you will find some friends here
how is she to day
tell me how miss fairfax is
but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism
he cut her short with
i am going to kingston
can i do any thing for you
dear kingston are you mrs
cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston
mrs cole has servants to send
no i thank you
but do come in
do put up your horse at the crown and come in
no not now i thank you
i could not stay two minutes
i must get on to kingston as fast as i can
they will be so very happy to see you
no no your room is full enough
i will call another day and hear the pianoforte
well i am so sorry oh
what is the matter now
to think of your sending us all your store apples
we really are so shocked
mrs hodges may well be angry
william larkins mentioned it here
you should not have done it indeed you should not
he never can bear to be thanked
mr knightley cannot stop
he is going to kingston
he asked me if he could do any thing
you must have heard every thing to be sure
can i do any thing for you at kingston
said he so i just mentioned
it may be possible to do without dancing entirely
yes that will be quite enough for pleasure
but soon it came to be on one side
five couple are nothing when one thinks seriously about it
it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment
the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other
i could not bear it for emma emma is not strong
she would catch a dreadful cold
so would poor little harriet
so you would all
pray do not let them talk of it
that young man speaking lower is very thoughtless
he does not think of the draught
mrs weston was sorry for such a charge
we were too magnificent said he
we allowed unnecessary room
ten couple may stand here very well
but still he went on measuring and still he ended with
i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple
it would be dreadful to be standing so close
there is no denying it he replied
i agree with you exactly
it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement
it is his own idea
this is what we all feel
you were perfectly right
papa do you not think it an excellent improvement
if they must dance they had better dance at randalls
no a very bad plan
they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere
mr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill
from the very circumstance of its being larger sir
nobody could be so imprudent
i never heard of such a thing
i have often known it done myself
have you indeed sir bless me
i never could have supposed it
one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry
but unfortunately sir my time is so limited
there is no hurry at all
they will be so near their own stable
so they will my dear
that is a great thing
i do not know her even by sight
mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole
mr perry did say so
i shall never forget it
he came four times a day for a week
i was desired to say so from both
they can do nothing satisfactorily without you
my dear you are too particular said her husband
what does all that signify
you will see nothing of it by candlelight
it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight
we never see any thing of it on our club nights
it regarded a supper room
what was to be done
this made a difficulty
we shall not be many you know
yes very true cried frank very true
you want your neighbours opinions
i do not wonder at you
they are not far off
shall i call upon them
i think we do want a larger council
suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us
she will not even listen to your questions
i see no advantage in consulting miss bates
but she is so amusing so extremely amusing
i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk
and i need not bring the whole family you know
we are growing a little too nice
she is a standing lesson of how to be happy
but fetch them both
can the old lady
no the young lady to be sure
i beg your pardon sir
i did not immediately recollect
and away he ran
all the rest in speculation at least was perfectly smooth
and a delightful dance it was to be
i knew he would
but this was not judged feasible
those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different
it made her animated open hearted she voluntarily said
miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball
what a disappointment it would be
there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr knightley
as to his going it was inevitable
he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it
his dejection was most evident
of all horrid things leave taking is the worst
but you will come again said emma
this will not be your only visit to randalls
our poor ball must be quite given up
miss woodhouse why are you always so right
i would much rather have been merry than wise
my father depends on it
do not forget your engagement
such a fortnight as it has been
happy those who can remain at highbury
do not we rather surpass your expectations
i am sure we do
i am sure you did not much expect to like us
and you must be off this very morning
i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him
it was a right thing to do
it was better to pay my visit then
he hesitated got up walked to a window
he looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts
she hardly knew what to say
she heard him sigh
he could not believe her to be encouraging him
my regard for hartfield is most warm
a very few minutes more however completed the present trial
i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you
i have engaged mrs weston to correspond with me
she has been so kind as to promise it
in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again
it was a sad change
they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival
i certainly must said she
evil to some is always good to others
mr knightley however shewed no triumphant happiness
emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love
her ideas only varied as to the how much
their affection was always to subside into friendship
i do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness
so much the better
i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do
i am quite enough in love
i should be sorry to be more
pray make my excuses and adieus to her
this emma could not doubt was all for herself
her intentions were unchanged
i know the danger of indulging such speculations
emma grew sick at the sound
at last emma attacked her on another ground
it was all my doing i know
do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it
these are the motives which i have been pressing on you
my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration
i want you to save yourself from greater pain
this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest
miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been
there is nothing to be compared to it
a thousand vexatious thoughts would recur
she did not really like her
emma thought at least it would turn out so
yes very a very pleasing young woman
i think her beautiful quite beautiful
very nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown
well i wish them happy with all my heart
he called her augusta
when the visit was returned emma made up her mind
she could then see more and judge better
harriet would have been a better match
i really could not help exclaiming
i have spent so many happy months there
with a little sigh of sentiment
a charming place undoubtedly
i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony
so extremely like maple grove
my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place
emma doubted the truth of this sentiment
surry is full of beauties
yes i am quite aware of that
it is the garden of england you know
surry is the garden of england
i never heard any county but surry called so
no not immediately here
there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort
nobody can be more devoted to home than i am
i was quite a proverb for it at maple grove
why does not he try bath indeed he should
let me recommend bath to you
in my bath life i have seen such instances of it
the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally understood
it was as much as emma could bear without being impolite
no indeed i must protest against any such idea
a superior performer very far from it i assure you
consider from how partial a quarter your information came
you miss woodhouse i well know play delightfully
i absolutely cannot do without music
i could do very well without it
i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description
i am delighted to find myself in such a circle
i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together
will not it be a good plan
they are but too apt to give up music
upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright
i like them extremely
she was your governess i think
but she is really quite the gentlewoman
and who do you think came in while we were there
emma was quite at a loss
knightley is quite the gentleman
i like him very much
decidedly i think a very gentleman like man
happily it was now time to be gone
they were off and emma could breathe
was her immediate exclamation
worse than i had supposed
knightley i could not have believed it
actually to discover that mr knightley is a gentleman
i could not have believed it
one would fancy we were bosom friends
i never met with her equal
much beyond my hopes
harriet is disgraced by any comparison
what would frank churchill say to her if he were here
how angry and how diverted he would be
there i am thinking of him directly
always the first person to be thought of
how i catch myself out
frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind
she speaks a little too quick
a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear
though i think he had better not have married
but i ought to have gone before
not to wait upon a bride is very remiss
it shews what a sad invalid i am
but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane
i dare say your apologies were accepted sir
mr elton knows you
it was being very deficient
my dear you do not understand me
her observation had been pretty correct
he seemed not merely happy with her but proud
they were sneering and negligent
i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well
i know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point
she is absolutely charming
we must bring her forward
we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax
and i think she feels it
i am sure she does
she is very timid and silent
one can see that she feels the want of encouragement
i like her the better for it
i must confess it is a recommendation to me
you and i need not be afraid
i have no idea of that sort of thing
poor jane fairfax
thought emma you have not deserved this
elton jane fairfax and jane fairfax
she is a riddle quite a riddle
the decree is issued by somebody
with a faint blush she presently replied
we feel things differently
are you there but you are miserably behindhand
mr cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago
in a moment he went on
that will never be however i can assure you
you are not vain mr knightley
i will say that for you
so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax
no indeed i have not
what i said just now meant nothing
mr knightley was thoughtful again
she has a fault
emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault
cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours
mrs weston your argument weighs most with me
do not beat me
i see how it is said she
i see what a life i am to lead among you
upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated
we really seem quite the fashion
no invitation came amiss to her
a dinner there must be
the persons to be invited required little thought
i have neglected her too long
but i will shew her greater attention than i have done
every invitation was successful
a circumstance rather unlucky occurred
the event was more favourable to mr woodhouse than to emma
i hope you turned directly
it is my daily errand
i always fetch the letters when i am here
it saves trouble and is a something to get me out
a walk before breakfast does me good
not a walk in the rain i should imagine
mr john knightley smiled and replied
there was a little blush and then this answer
no i never conceived you could become indifferent
you are not serious now
i consider one as including the other
it was kindly said and very far from giving offence
they should take care of their health and their complexion
my dear did you change your stockings
they are some of my very old friends
i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour
jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold
mrs weston did you ever hear the like
you and i must positively exert our authority
the spring i always think requires more than common care
now do not you feel that you had
yes i am sure you are much too reasonable
you look as if you would not do such a thing again
my dear jane say no more about it
the post office is a wonderful establishment
said she the regularity and despatch of it
it is certainly very well regulated
so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears
that is the key to a great deal of capacity
the public pays and must be served well
isabella and emma i think do write very much alike
i have not always known their writing apart
i certainly get better and better now for it
i do not admire it said mr knightley
it is too small wants strength
this was not submitted to by either lady
they vindicated him against the base aspersion
had not mrs weston any letter about her to produce
he chose to say he was employed
dinner was on table mrs
must i go first
i really am ashamed of always leading the way
mrs elton left them no choice
here is april come
said she i get quite anxious about you
june will soon be here
but have you really heard of nothing
wax candles in the schoolroom
you may imagine how desirable
aye i know your scruples
your inexperience really amuses me
my dear human flesh
something that would do
repeated mrs elton
do you think it will look well
as to her illness all nothing of course
this is precisely what i wanted
well pretty good news is not it
have you finished it
has emma read it all
mrs weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion
her looks and words had nothing to restrain them
yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance
we have notice of it in a letter to day
she is his principal correspondent i assure you
i hardly ever get a letter
and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her
mr weston i could not have believed it of you
aye we men are sad fellows
you must take care of yourself mrs
indeed from yorkshire i think
enscombe is in yorkshire
yes upon my word very considerable
sixty five miles farther than from maple grove to london
certainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions mrs elton
you must grant me that
no indeed i shall grant you nothing
i always take the part of my own sex
she always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution
does mrs churchill do the same
mrs elton eagerly interposed with
mr weston do not mistake me
selina is no fine lady i assure you
do not run away with such an idea
weston to bath or to clifton
it is a retired place
a fine place but very retired
aye like maple grove i dare say
nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove
such an immense plantation all round it
frank was here in february for a fortnight
so i remember to have heard
nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible
he had done his duty and could return to his son
it has been completely unexpected
he and mrs weston were both dreadfully desponding
how could he contrive to come
very true mr weston perfectly true
you were mentioning may
now will be the time
i think it is so
she thinks nobody equal to him
mr weston was musing
she was the instigator
well that must be infinitely provoking
i have quite a horror of upstarts
your description of mrs churchill made me think of them directly
one has not great hopes from birmingham
it is infinitely too bad
mr john knightley proved more talkative than his brother
that is very likely
you think so do not you
no indeed i am not
witness this very time
your neighbourhood is increasing and you mix more with it
let them be sent to donwell
i shall certainly be at leisure
upon my word exclaimed emma you amuse me
these amazing engagements of mine what have they been
that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance
and yet she could not help rather anticipating something decisive
they met with the utmost friendliness
there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her
she watched him well
it was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference
his aunt could not bear to have him leave her
such was his own account at randall s
it soon appeared that london was not the place for her
she could not endure its noise
they were going to remove immediately to richmond
emma saw how mr weston understood these joyous prospects
she hoped it was not so
two months must bring it to the proof
he was quite delighted
it was the very circumstance he could have wished for
now it would be really having frank in their neighbourhood
he would be always coming over
mr woodhouse was resigned
the time of year lightened the evil to him
may was better for every thing than february
no misfortune occurred again to prevent the ball
no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma
so unreasonably early
mrs elton was spoken of
i think she must be here soon said he
it cannot be long i think before she comes
a carriage was heard
he was on the move immediately but coming back said
i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her
i have never seen either mr or mrs elton
i have no business to put myself forward
but miss bates and miss fairfax
said mr weston looking about
we thought you were to bring them
the mistake had been slight
the carriage was sent for them now
a very fine young man indeed mr weston
they were never tolerated at maple grove
mrs elton turned to mrs weston
as the door opened she was heard
so very obliging of you no rain at all
i do not care for myself
good mrs stokes would not know her own room again
she was now met by mrs
i hope you are quite well
very happy to hear it
delighted to hear it indeed
jane and i quite ready
did not keep the horses a moment
most comfortable carriage oh
thank you my mother is remarkably well
gone to mr woodhouse s
colonel campbell rather preferred an olive
my mother often talks of your good nature
dr hughes i declare and mrs hughes
how do you do very well i thank you
don t disturb him
much better employed talking to the young ladies
how do you do mr
arthur how do you do
and such a noble fire i am quite roasted
every thing so good
whether he were overhearing too she could not determine
with many other relative questions all answered with patient politeness
i like him very well
elton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming
how do you like mrs
said emma in a whisper
you are ungrateful
ungrateful what do you mean
emma could hardly understand him he seemed in an odd humour
said mr weston
she will think frank ought to ask her
it was almost enough to make her think of marrying
there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner
they seemed more like cheerful easy friends than lovers
the ball proceeded pleasantly
escape however was not his plan
no i would get you a better partner than myself
i am no dancer
you will excuse me
this was mr elton
the amiable obliging gentle mr
she would not look again
mrs weston begs you to put on your tippet
mr churchill oh
you are too obliging
how well you put it on so gratified
sir you are most kind
two steps jane take care of the two steps
no there is but one
well i was persuaded there were two
i was convinced there were two and there is but one
i am all amazement
where shall we sit
anywhere so that jane is not in a draught
what you direct in this house cannot be wrong
they aimed at wounding more than harriet said he
emma why is it that they are your enemies
i shall not scold you
i leave you to your own reflections
it was through a series of strange blunders
i found harriet more conversable than i expected
every body is lazy
every body is asleep
whom are you going to dance with
asked mr knightley
said he offering his hand
brother and sister
this little explanation with mr knightley gave emma considerable pleasure
she was not to see frank churchill this morning
she did not regret it
a few minutes made emma acquainted with the whole
but poor harriet could not follow
so emma thought at least
it was a very extraordinary thing
she would not stir a step nor drop a hint
no she had had enough of interference
it was no more than a wish
beyond it she would on no account proceed
within half an hour it was known all over highbury
emma was a good deal surprized but begged her to speak
yes said emma i hope i do
how i could so long a time be fancying myself
cried harriet warmly
it seems like madness
cannot you guess what this parcel holds
said she with a conscious look
her curiosity was greatly excited
harriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with impatience
no indeed i do not
my dearest harriet
and had you really some at hand yourself
and secretly she added to herself lord bless me
i never was equal to this
emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure
i have an idea he was standing just here
my poor dear harriet
and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things
i shall be happier to burn it replied harriet
it has a disagreeable look to me
never marry this is a new resolution
it is one that i shall never change however
mr elton indeed
cried harriet indignantly oh
she then took a longer time for consideration
plain dealing was always best
i am not at all surprized at you harriet
the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart
in one moment such a change
from perfect misery to perfect happiness
it is very natural
i do not advise you to give way to it harriet
i do not by any means engage for its being returned
consider what you are about
be observant of him
let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations
i am determined against all interference
henceforward i know nothing of the matter
let no name ever pass our lips
but take care of yourself
harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude
to highbury in general it brought no material change
that emma was his object appeared indisputable
myself creating what i saw
the gentlemen spoke of his horse
nay i had it from you
you wrote me word of it three months ago
indeed you did
i remember it perfectly
you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon
you must remember it now
upon my word i never heard of it till this moment
really never bless me
you will not be sorry to find yourself at home
what is this what is this
cried mr weston about perry and a carriage
is perry going to set up his carriage frank
i am glad he can afford it
you had it from himself had you
i am a great dreamer
what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream
and at others what a heap of absurdities it is
emma you are a great dreamer i think
emma was out of hearing
i am not like jane i wish i were
where is she oh
they were entering the hall
mr weston had walked in
the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass
there was no time for farther remark or explanation
tea passed pleasantly and nobody seemed in a hurry to move
it used to stand here
we had great amusement with those letters one morning
i want to puzzle you again
frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax
the word was discovered and with a faint smile pushed away
he feared there must be some decided involvement
disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn
these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick
and as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth
it was done however
it is time for us to be going indeed
my dear sir you are too obliging
we really must wish you good night
it was his duty
emma was extremely confused
he had hoped she would speak again but she did not
she would rather busy herself about any thing than speak
he sat a little while in doubt
a variety of evils crossed his mind
interference fruitless interference
yet he would speak
between mr frank churchill and miss fairfax
yes perfectly why do you make a doubt of it
and how could it possibly come into your head
you amuse me excessively
no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present
mrs elton was very much disappointed
it was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade
they could go there again with them in the autumn
it was settled that they should go to box hill
but i thought you would
such schemes as these are nothing without numbers
one cannot have too large a party
a large party secures its own amusement
and she is a good natured woman after all
one could not leave her out
is not this most vexations knightley
you had better explore to donwell replied mr knightley
that may be done without horses
come and eat my strawberries
they are ripening fast
you may depend upon me said she
i certainly will come
name your day and i will come
you will allow me to bring jane fairfax
leave all that to me
it is my party
i will bring friends with me
now you are looking very sly
i am no young lady on her preferment
married women you know may be safely authorised
it is my party
leave it all to me
i will invite your guests
you are an odd creature
i have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family
i know you are attached to them
here probably this basket with pink ribbon
nothing can be more simple you see
and jane will have such another
every thing as natural and simple as possible
is not that your idea
i wish we had a donkey
i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey
you will not find either between donwell and highbury
donwell lane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry
come on a donkey however if you prefer it
you can borrow mrs cole s
that i am sure you would
indeed i do you justice my good friend
you have hit upon the very thing to please me
he was invited on good faith
no lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity
he had not been at donwell for two years
the pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear
now they seemed in pleasant conversation
he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc
she did not suspect him
mrs weston looked and looked in vain
mr woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused
it would only be giving trouble and distress
yes what should hurt me i walk fast
i shall be at home in twenty minutes
it can be round in five minutes
i must order the carriage
the heat even would be danger you are fatigued already
mine i confess are exhausted
emma had not another word to oppose
miss woodhouse the comfort of being sometimes alone
such a home indeed
said emma as she turned back into the hall again
mrs weston would be at ease
as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again
some people were always cross when they were hot
no he should not eat
he was not hungry it would only make him hotter
emma returned all her attention to her father saying in secret
i am glad i have done being in love with him
they were looking over views in swisserland
i shall do something to expose myself
that may be but not by sketches in swisserland
you will never go to swisserland
your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave england
they may be induced to go too
a warm climate may be prescribed for her
i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad
i assure you i have
i ought to travel
i am tired of doing nothing
i want a change
you are sick of prosperity and indulgence
you are quite mistaken
i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged
i am thwarted in every thing material
i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person
no i shall not stir
i shall sit by you
you are my best cure
you will stay and go with us
no it will not be worth while
if i come i shall be cross
then pray stay at richmond
but if i do i shall be crosser still
i can never bear to think of you all there without me
these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself
chuse your own degree of crossness
i shall press you no more
mrs weston remained with mr woodhouse
nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there
they separated too much into parties
at first it was downright dulness to emma
she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid
every distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her
mr frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively
she still intended him for her friend
i had quite determined to go away again
i was a kinder friend than you deserved
but you were humble
you begged hard to be commanded to come
don t say i was cross
the heat overcame me
it is hotter to day
not to my feelings
i am perfectly comfortable to day
you are comfortable because you are under command
your command yes
it comes to the same thing
i can have no self command without a motive
you order me whether you speak or not
and you can be always with me
you are always with me
dating from three o clock yesterday
three o clock yesterday
that is your date
i thought i had seen you first in february
your gallantry is really unanswerable
i saw you first in february
let every body on the hill hear me if they can
i saw you first in february
and then whispering our companions are excessively stupid
what shall we do to rouse them
any nonsense will serve
some laughed and answered good humouredly
i will not say quite all
very true my love very true
better pass it off as a joke
i will attack them with more address
three things very dull indeed
that will just do for me you know
emma could not resist
ma am but there may be a difficulty
ah well to be sure
i like your plan cried mr weston
i will do my best
i am making a conundrum
how will a conundrum reckon
come sir pray let me hear it
what two letters express perfection
i am sure i do not know
you will never guess
and a em ma do you understand
understanding and gratification came together
i knew who it came from
miss woodhouse must excuse me
i do not pretend to be a wit
pass us if you please mr churchill
pass mr e knightley jane and myself
we have nothing clever to say not one of us
an old married man quite good for nothing
shall we walk augusta
with all my heart
i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot
come jane take my other arm
such things do occur undoubtedly
she was stopped by a cough
frank churchill turned towards her to listen
you were speaking said he gravely
she recovered her voice
turning to emma
find some body for me
i am in no hurry
adopt her educate her
and make her like myself
by all means if you can
i undertake the commission
you shall have a charming wife
she must be very lively and have hazle eyes
i care for nothing else
emma was in no danger of forgetting
it was a commission to touch every favourite feeling
would not harriet be the very creature described
referring the education to her seemed to imply it
if you please my dear
with all my heart
i am quite ready
we shall soon overtake her
i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance
how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates
it was not so very bad
i dare say she did not understand me
i assure you she did
she felt your full meaning
she has talked of it since
her situation should secure your compassion
it was badly done indeed
he had turned away and the horses were in motion
she was most forcibly struck
the truth of this representation there was no denying
she felt it at her heart
time did not compose her
as she reflected more she seemed but to feel it more
she never had been so depressed
happily it was not necessary to speak
as a daughter she hoped she was not without a heart
miss bates should never again no never
but it should be so no more
she had no objection
the ladies were all at home
the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room
i dare say my daughter will be here presently miss woodhouse
i hope you find a chair
i wish hetty had not gone
do you sit where you like
i am sure she will be here presently
emma seriously hoped she would
the touch seemed immediate
one cannot wonder one cannot wonder
if you were to see what a headache she has
she is as low as possible
nobody else would come so early
but then patty came in and said it was you
emma was most sincerely interested
it must be a severe trial to them all
but you are always kind
where may i ask is miss fairfax going
jane will be only four miles from maple grove
yes our good mrs elton
the most indefatigable true friend
she would not take a denial
quite a surprize to me
you spent the evening with mrs
mr knightley was there too was he
i dare say she had
thank you dear miss woodhouse
you are so noble in your ideas
and when is miss fairfax to leave you
mrs smallridge is in a great hurry
my poor mother does not know how to bear it
that was what happened before tea
it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs
what is to become of that very true
you and i must part
nothing at all
but is not this a sudden scheme
she is always so attentive to them
it was a pity that she had not come back earlier
the great mrs churchill was no more
it was felt as such things must be felt
in one point she was fully justified
she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill
poor mrs churchill
mr churchill would never get over it
poor woman who would have thought it
how it would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both
it was also a very early speculation with emma
she saw in a moment all the possible good
now an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter
what ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing
she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield
a note was written to urge it
the invitation was refused and by a verbal message
her spirits seemed overcome
the answer was only in this short note
she was sorry very sorry
mrs weston wants to see you
she must see you
this moment if you please
it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way
but what can be the matter is she really not ill
depend upon me but ask no more questions
you will know it all in time
the most unaccountable business
to guess what all this meant was impossible even for emma
i promised my wife to leave it all to her
she will break it to you better than i can
no indeed you are mistaken
upon my word emma
i should not have used the expression
her fancy was very active
it inspired little more than an animating curiosity
who is that gentleman on horseback
you will not see him
he is half way to windsor by this time
has your son been with you then
i shall leave you together
there is no use in delay
i shall not be far off if you want me
she has not the least idea
what is it my dear friend
i have been walking all this way in complete suspense
we both abhor suspense
do not let mine continue longer
have you indeed no idea
said mrs weston in a trembling voice
it is impossible to express our surprize
she stopped to breathe
emma thought first of herself and then of harriet
jane fairfax good god
you are not serious
you do not mean it
but it is even so
i can hardly believe it i thought i knew him
it has hurt his father equally
fortunately however it did cease
you may believe me mrs weston
this is the simple truth
on this point we have been wretched
composure with a witness
he had not time to enter into much explanation
mrs weston it is too calm a censure
cried emma not attending to her mrs
jane actually on the point of going as governess
what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy
he knew nothing about it emma
on this article i can fully acquit him
emma began to listen better
let us wait therefore for this letter
it may bring many extenuations
let us have patience
well and how did mr churchill take it
conceive what the events of a week have done in that family
thought emma he would have done as much for harriet
emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush
but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding
but you really frightened me
i thought you had lost half your property at least
harriet poor harriet
to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery
she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments
her influence would have been enough
she was extremely angry with herself
this discovery laid many smaller matters open
but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge
there was little sympathy to be spared for any body else
emma had promised but still harriet must be excepted
it was her superior duty
well miss woodhouse
what news do you mean
about jane fairfax
did you ever hear any thing so strange
i met him just now
what did mr weston tell you
said emma still perplexed
her character appeared absolutely changed
emma looked at her quite unable to speak
cried harriet colouring and astonished
him never never
dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me
mr frank churchill indeed
are you speaking of mr
to be sure i am
when we talked about him it was as clear as possible
miss woodhouse how you do forget
she paused a few moments
emma could not speak
but you are too good for that i am sure
harriet was standing at one of the windows
she touched she admitted she acknowledged the whole truth
how improperly had she been acting by harriet
what blindness what madness had led her on
emma knew it to have been very much the case
but harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit
no indeed there was not a hint of mr martin
he was coming through the hall
harriet was too much agitated to encounter him
that i had never seen her
this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection
knightley every other part of her mind was disgusting
knightley and harriet smith such an elevation on her side
such a debasement on his
had she never brought harriet forward
was not that her own doing too
she had herself been first with him for many years past
nothing should separate her from her father
this was one of her expressions
pain is no expiation
i never can be blameless
she loves him then excessively i suppose
her affection must have overpowered her judgment
you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars
they shew her to the greatest advantage
such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs weston
are you well my emma
i am always well you know
she must have been a perpetual enemy
the weather added what it could of gloom
they would be married and settled either at or near enscombe
she must be collected and calm
in half a minute they were together
and this belief produced another dread
he must do it all himself
yet she could not bear this silence
with him it was most unnatural
she considered resolved and trying to smile began
the best nature in the world a wedding
how is it possible
they will soon be in yorkshire
she deserves a better fate
he listened in perfect silence
she wished him to speak but he would not
she went on however
many circumstances assisted the temptation
he has imposed on me but he has not injured me
i have never been attached to him
and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour
he never wished to attach me
at last and tolerably in his usual tone he said
he is a most fortunate man
returned mr knightley with energy
you speak as if you envied him
and i do envy him emma
in one respect he is the object of my envy
emma could say no more
take a little time consider do not commit yourself
emma could not bear to give him pain
you are going in i suppose
mr perry is not gone
i will tell you exactly what i think
say no if it is to be said
at present i ask no more
emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment
the manner perhaps may have as little to recommend them
her father and harriet
with respect to her father it was a question soon answered
my courage rises while i write
it is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble
this was the fact
i shall not discuss it here
we seemed to understand each other
i cannot doubt it
she frequently gave me hints of it
i want to have your opinion of her looks
perhaps it is paid already
you have not heard all that you ought to hear
but she was always right
i will take it home with me at night
but that would not do
a fine complimentary opening but it is his way
we will not be severe
by doing it i shall feel that i am near you
i should wish it
mr knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity
you pass it over very handsomely but you were perfectly right
you had better go on said she
after this he made some progress without any pause
you did behave very shamefully
you never wrote a truer line
her own behaviour had been so very improper
what does this mean
what is all this
only one page more
i shall soon have done
what a letter the man writes
dearer much dearer than ever
come he knows himself there
miss woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune
the child of good fortune
that was your name for him was it
i hope it does him some service with you
yes certainly it does
and now let me talk to you of something else
she could never quit him
part only of this answer however was admitted
she was sensible of all the affection it evinced
there is one difficulty unprovided for cried emma
i am sure william larkins will not like it
you must get his consent before you ask mine
she would be a loser in every way
their intercourse was painful enough by letter
how much worse had they been obliged to meet
mrs bates and mrs elton were together
miss bates was out which accounted for the previous tranquillity
we can finish this some other time you know
you and i shall not want opportunities
and in fact you have heard all the essential already
you see how delightfully she writes
she is a sweet creature
no cautious as a minister of state
i managed it extremely well
emma could not doubt
it was a palpable display repeated on every possible occasion
no perry shall have all the credit
but yet i think there was something wanting
perry such attention to jane
are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr
elton that will be a favour indeed
yes quite indispensable
miss bates looked about her so happily
have not you mistaken the day
we never heard of such things at maple grove
your parish there was small said jane
what a thinking brain you have
mr elton made his appearance
his lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity
and then not to find him at home
i assure you i am not at all pleased
and no apology left no message for me
emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly
the danger would have been of my wearying you
you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest
i feel it so very due
pray say no more
i feel that all the apologies should be on my side
let us forgive each other at once
i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor
i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs
the smile was returned as jane answered
you are very right it has been thought of
she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston
it will be the only difference
nothing very bad the fate of thousands
i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it
do you i have no doubt
nature gave you understanding miss taylor gave you principles
you must have done well
my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good
i do not believe i did you any good
i am very sure you did me good
and cannot you call me george now
he might observe that it was so
here is his answer if you like to see it
it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage
but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes
i honour his sincerity
my emma he means no such thing
emma my dear emma
he had no idea of me
he seems perfectly unprepared for that
that was all very true
it was all right all open all equal
no sacrifice on any side worth the name
he told her the news
in general it was a very well approved match
it would never do
i have something to tell you emma some news
said she quickly looking up in his face
i do not know which it ought to be called
good i am sure i see it in your countenance
you are trying not to smile
have you heard from her yourself this morning
you have i believe and know the whole
harriet smith marries robert martin
but her lips were closed
he left me not half an hour ago
she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement
but in time they will
you only mean that he intends it
she cried well
how where when let me know it all
it is a very simple story
my friend robert could not resist
he stopped emma dared not attempt any immediate reply
she must wait a moment or he would think her mad
i think harriet is doing extremely well
i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize
you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me
it could not be otherwise
do you dare say this
cried mr knightley
he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do
i assured him that i could not
you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before
i have often talked to her a good deal
you must have seen that i did
cried emma shaking her head ah
their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father
she was not sorry
she wanted to be alone
she must laugh at such a close
such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back
such a heart such a harriet
it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin
they arrived mrs
it is frank and miss fairfax said mrs weston
in half a minute they were in the room
i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon
i hope you do not retract what you then said
is not she looking well
said he turning his eyes towards jane
early i know you had none
i never had the smallest i assure you
that appears quite wonderful
it is not now worth a regret said emma
do not you pity me
did you ever see such a skin such smoothness
so peculiarly the lady in it just colour enough for beauty
i was the most miserable wretch
not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth
i think there is a little likeness between us
true true he answered warmly
no not true on your side
is not she an angel in every gesture
observe the turn of her throat
they are to be new set
i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head
will not it be beautiful in her dark hair
how delighted i am to see you again
frank churchill caught the name
my friend mr perry
what are they saying about mr
such an extraordinary dream of mine
still however he was not happy
this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened
elliot of kellynch hall
his two other children were of very inferior value
elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment
sir walter has resented it
his disapprobation was expressed but apparently very little regarded
this could not be pardoned
her father was growing distressed for money
elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy
no he would never disgrace his name so far
they must retrench that did not admit of a doubt
i have great hope of prevailing
she wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty
every comfort of life knocked off
to live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman
quit kellynch hall
anne had been too little from home too little seen
her spirits were not high
a larger society would improve them
she wanted her to be more known
kellynch hall was to be let
how quick come the reasons for approving what we like
this peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore
they will be all wanting a home
many a noble fortune has been made during the war
sir walter only nodded
i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant
after a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say
your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands
sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow
very true very true
was the reply and with a look of surprise
i have observed it all my life
in the name of heaven who is that old fellow
cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin
what do you take his age to be
sixty said i or perhaps sixty two
have a little mercy on the poor men
we are not all born to be handsome
and who is admiral croft
he is a rear admiral of the white
what was his name
i shall forget my own name soon i suppose
after waiting another moment
you mean mr wentworth i suppose
mr shepherd was all gratitude
wentworth was the very name
mr wentworth was the very man
you remember him i am sure
ay mr wentworth the curate of monkford
you misled me by the term gentleman
captain wentworth had no fortune
she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil
it only added a dangerous character to himself
he was brilliant he was headstrong
she deprecated the connexion in every light
he had left the country in consequence
all his sanguine expectations all his confidence had been justified
how eloquent could anne elliot have been
reciprocal compliments which would have been esteemed about equal
something occurred however to give her a different duty
she spoke and seemed only to offend
freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him
her friend was not in better spirits than herself
lady russell felt this break up of the family exceedingly
here anne had often been staying
she knew the ways of uppercross as well as those of kellynch
so you are come at last
i began to think i should never see you
i am so ill i can hardly speak
i have not seen a creature the whole morning
i am sorry to find you unwell replied anne
you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday
so lady russell would not get out
anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband
charles is out shooting
i have not seen him since seven o clock
he would go though i told him how ill i was
you have had your little boys with you
you know i always cure you when i come
how are your neighbours at the great house
i can give you no account of them
i never want them i assure you
they talk and laugh a great deal too much for me
anne i am so very unwell
it was quite unkind of you not to come on thursday
what can you possibly have to do
a great many things i assure you
i was told that they wished it
but all these things took up a great deal of time
did you go then
it would have been strange if i had not gone
mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were so crowded
where shall we go
said she when they were ready
but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible
they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister
the portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment
their children had more modern minds and manners
they were received with great cordiality
she had no dread of these two months
they are quite different creatures with you
but to be sure in general they are so spoilt
how troublesome they are sometimes
she had this communication moreover from mary
how was anne to set all these matters to rights
in all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well
the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company
there were more completely popular
very well done indeed
how those little fingers of yours fly about
so passed the first three weeks
i am glad i did not think of it before
how low it makes me
mary deplored the necessity for herself
nobody knew how much she should suffer
perhaps you may not have heard that he is married
i will tell you why she is out of spirits
only think if anything should happen
anne will send for me if anything is the matter
husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain
i knew how it would be
this is always my luck
talks of his being going on so well
i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling
i am not at all equal to it
you saw how hysterical i was yesterday
you will not be hysterical again
i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us
i have not nerves for the sort of thing
i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is
leave little charles to my care
are you serious
cried mary her eyes brightening
and it only harasses me
an excellent thought of yours indeed anne
i will go and tell charles and get ready directly
perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances
he must be either indifferent or unwilling
he wished to avoid seeing her
and it was soon over
she repeated to herself again and again in nervous gratitude
the worst is over
mary talked but she could not attend
she had seen him
they had been once more in the same room
what might not eight years do
it included nearly a third part of her own life
now how were his sentiments to be read
was this like wishing to avoid her
altered beyond his knowledge
anne fully submitted in silent deep mortification
she had seen the same frederick wentworth
so altered that he should not have known her again
these were words which could not but dwell with her
yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them
he had not forgiven anne elliot
she had given him up to oblige others
it had been the effect of over persuasion
it had been weakness and timidity
her power with him was gone for ever
it was now his object to marry
anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking
he said it she knew to be contradicted
that is the woman i want said he
once so much to each other
it was a perpetual estrangement
you will not find her there
quite worn out and broken up
i was the last man who commanded her
hardly fit for service then
the girls looked all amazement
cried the admiral what stuff these young fellows talk
never was a better sloop than the asp in her day
for an old built sloop you would not see her equal
lucky fellow to get her
to be sure you did
she was a dear old asp to me
she did all that i wanted
i knew she would
i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck
it was at gibraltar mother i know
those were pleasant days when i had the laconia
how fast i made money in her
poor harville sister
you know how much he wanted money worse than myself
i shall never forget his happiness
he felt it all so much for her sake
and i am sure sir
we shall never forget what you did
poor dear fellow
it was no insignificant barrier indeed
personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions
i am glad i was not a week later then
the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry
this brought his sister upon him
but i cannot believe it of you
all idle refinement
nothing to the purpose replied her brother
where was this superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then
all merged in my friendship sophia
depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable
i might not like them the better for that perhaps
my dear frederick you are talking quite idly
ay that we shall
now i have done cried captain wentworth
when once married people begin to attack me with oh
you will think very differently when you are married
he got up and moved away
said mrs musgrove to mrs croft
aye to be sure
yes indeed oh yes
there is nothing so bad as a separation
i am quite of your opinion
the evening ended with dancing
she had rather play
she is never tired of playing
once too he spoke to her
anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches
his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything
it was soon uppercross with him almost every day
mrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters
it would be a capital match for either of his sisters
upon my word it would replied mary
if he should rise to any very great honours
if he should ever be made a baronet
lady wentworth sounds very well
that would be a noble thing indeed for henrietta
sir frederick and lady wentworth
and pray who is charles hayter
nothing but a country curate
a most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross
she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday
i wish you had been there to see her behaviour
but charles is so positive
when he came back alas
the zeal of the business was gone by
is he coming louisa
she only attempted to say how do you do
will you not sit down
the others will be here presently
another minute brought another addition
walter said she get down this moment
you are extremely troublesome
i am very angry with you
do not you hear your aunt speak
come to me walter come to cousin charles
but not a bit did walter stir
her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless
she could not even thank him
she could only hang over little charles with most disordered feelings
she could not stay
other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur
she did not attribute guile to any
there was no triumph no pitiful triumph in his manner
anne could only feel that charles hayter was wise
just as they were setting off the gentlemen returned
he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta
louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister
what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister
they talked of coming into this side of the country
i wonder whereabouts they will upset to day
it was spoken with enthusiasm
cried he catching the same tone i honour you
and there was silence between them for a little while
anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again
but nobody heard or at least nobody answered her
mary exclaimed bless me
i declare i had no idea
said charles musgrove and no no
it is very unpleasant having such connexions
she turned through the same gate but could not see them
they were speaking as they drew near
she seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech
what anne first heard was
and so i made her go
no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded
she would have turned back then but for you
she would indeed
i am almost ashamed to say it
but this no doubt you have been always doing
let those who would be happy be firm
not a puncture not a weak spot anywhere
he had done and was unanswered
she could imagine what louisa was feeling
before they were beyond her hearing however louisa spoke again
she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride
we do so wish that charles had married anne instead
i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne
do you mean that she refused him
when did that happen
i wish she had accepted him
the sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no more
her own emotions still kept her fixed
she had much to recover from before she could move
her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give
the invitation was general and generally declined
the something might be guessed by its effects
do let us have the pleasure of taking you home
here is excellent room for three i assure you
you must indeed you must
yes he had done it
this little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before
he could not forgive her but he could not be unfeeling
she then found them talking of frederick
ay this comes of the peace
i had known you by character however long before
i do not like having such things so long in hand
then there would always be company for them
one could not be connected with better people
my dear admiral that post
we shall certainly take that post
he had been there for four and twenty hours
the young people were all wild to see lyme
they had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion
she had died the preceding summer while he was at sea
i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever
he will rally again and be happy with another
they all met and were introduced
do not you anne
i wish his friends would propose it to him
i really think they ought
they were all at her disposal
both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea
anne felt that she should like to know who he was
it was driven by a servant in mourning
the waiter came into the room soon afterwards
charles anne must not it
in the very same inn with us
anne must not it be our mr elliot
cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said
heir to sir walter elliot
i was sure that would come out if it was so
but anne only conceive how extraordinary
i wish i had looked at him more
do you think he had the elliot countenance
i wish he could have such company oftener
and not known to him perhaps so soon
anne found captain benwick again drawing near her
it was soon drawn perforce another way
the horror of the moment to all who stood around
is there no one to help me
i can support her myself
leave me and go to him
her father and mother
captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick
he knows where a surgeon is to be found
both seemed to look to her for directions
had not she better be carried to the inn
yes i am sure carry her gently to the inn
i will carry her myself
musgrove take care of the others
they were not off the cobb before the harvilles met them
mary too was growing calmer
the surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible
the tone the look with which thank god
there was no injury but to the head
they were now able to speak to each other and consult
her removal was impossible
every minute is valuable
some one must resolve on being off for uppercross instantly
musgrove either you or i must go
charles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away
she however was soon persuaded to think differently
the usefulness of her staying
she coloured deeply and he recollected himself and moved away
she expressed herself most willing ready happy to remain
one thing more and all seemed arranged
why was not she to be as useful as anne
and to go home without charles too without her husband
no it was too unkind
she endeavoured to be composed and to be just
in the mean while she was in the carriage
it was all quite natural however
in general his voice and manner were studiously calm
to spare henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle
that i had not given way to her at the fatal moment
had i done as i ought
but so eager and so resolute
dear sweet louisa
they got on fast
in a low cautious voice he said
i have been considering what we had best do
she must not appear at first
she could not stand it
do you think this is a good plan
she did he was satisfied and said no more
end of volume one
they had an early account from lyme the next morning
louisa was much the same
no symptoms worse than before had appeared
he was tolerably cheerful
she really left nothing for mary to do
mary had been hysterical again this morning
the intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger
what should they do without her
they were wretched comforters for one another
a few days had made a change indeed
if louisa recovered it would all be well again
more than former happiness would be restored
scenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious
she knew who had been frequenting uppercross
they must speak of the accident at lyme
anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell
when this was told his name distressed her no longer
it will be some trial to us both
by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it
oh how fallen in their destination
an ancient family to be so driven away
strangers filling their place
the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming
ay a very bad business indeed
this is breaking a head and giving a plaster truly
his goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible
but now do not stand upon ceremony
another time sir i thank you not now
well whenever it suits you
a good place is not it
ay so it always is i believe
we told you about the laundry door at uppercross
that has been a very great improvement
my wife should have the credit of them however
such a number of looking glasses
pray say so with my compliments
he will be glad to hear it
they had been all in lodgings together
i do not know what he would be at
it was all your doing turning to anne
she boldly acknowledged herself flattered and continued her enquiries
i declare anne he never talks of you at all
elegance sweetness beauty
miss harville only died last june
i am sure you will agree with me
so i give you notice lady russell
he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived
he is not at all a well bred young man
i am sure you will not like him
there we differ mary said anne
i think lady russell would like him
so do i anne said charles
i am sure lady russell would like him
give him a book and he will read all day long
yes that he will
exclaimed mary tauntingly
do you think lady russell would like that
lady russell could not help laughing
i wish he may be induced to call here
you will not like him i will answer for it
lady russell began talking of something else
his spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected
captain benwick came not however
it was a fine family piece
louisa was now recovering apace
anne did not share these feelings
mr elliot was in bath
she had a great wish to see him
when shall i leave you again
they had no inclination to listen to her
their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after
everybody was wanting to visit them
here were funds of enjoyment
could anne wonder that her father and sister were happy
but this was not all which they had to make them happy
they had mr elliot too
anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot
he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him
they had not a fault to find in him
it had originated in misapprehension entirely
there had been the charm
she had sought him
here was a great deal to soften the business
anne listened but without quite understanding it
she heard it all under embellishment
yes perhaps it had been mr elliot
they did not know
it might be him perhaps
they could not listen to her description of him
they were describing him themselves sir walter especially
he did not mean to complain however
colonel wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them
and mr elliot so anxious that he should
he longed to see her
the worst of bath was the number of its plain women
they were infinitely worse
such scarecrows as the streets were full of
he was not allowed to escape however
how is mary looking
said sir walter in the height of his good humour
no that must have been quite accidental
a knock at the door
it was ten o clock
could it be mr elliot
they knew he was to dine in lansdown crescent
they could think of no one else
mrs clay was right
he sat down with them and improved their conversation very much
there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man
ten minutes were enough to certify that
his regret increased as he listened
if he had but asked who the party were
the name of musgrove would have told him enough
having alluded to an accident he must hear the whole
he staid an hour with them
i assure you i feel it none
as yet you have seen nothing of bath
you have been here only to be useful
you must not run away from us now
had she been using any thing in particular
merely gowland he supposed
no nothing at all
you see how it has carried away her freckles
if elizabeth could but have heard this
but everything must take its chance
she was sure that he had not been happy in marriage
her satisfaction in mr elliot outweighed all the plague of mrs clay
very well time will explain
she could determine nothing at present
a little delay on his side might be very excusable
they did not always think alike
his value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers
no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland
the toils of the business were over the sweets began
there was no superiority of manner accomplishment or understanding
anne smiled and said
my cousin anne shakes her head
she is not satisfied
will it make you happy
she was a widow and poor
it would excite no proper interest there
the first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion
she had been used to affluence it was gone
how could it be
she always takes the right time for applying
she is a shrewd intelligent sensible woman
a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes
there is so little real friendship in the world
anne saw the misery of such feelings
i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however
at last it became necessary to speak of her
she was not sorry for the excuse
a widow mrs smith and who was her husband
and what is her attraction
that she is old and sickly
what is her age
but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance
a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings
she made no reply
lady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot
for a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched
she never could accept him
she distrusted the past if not the present
how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed
this to anne was a decided imperfection
her early impressions were incurable
warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still
mr elliot was too generally agreeable
he endured too well stood too well with every body
she wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated
it was three weeks since she had heard at all
the crofts must be in bath
a circumstance to interest her
they were people whom her heart turned to very naturally
the crofts have arrived in bath
the crofts who rent kellynch
what have they brought you
a letter from uppercross cottage sir
those letters are convenient passports
they secure an introduction
i should have visited admiral croft however at any rate
i know what is due to my tenant
it had been begun several days back
i do not reckon the hayters as anybody
i am sure i had not
i do not understand it
what dreadful weather we have had
what an immense time mrs clay has been staying with elizabeth
does she never mean to go away
let me know what you think of this
i do not expect my children to be asked you know
i do not think they improve at all as neighbours
charles joins me in love and everything proper
i shall be truly glad to have them back again
our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family
but now for louisa
i have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little
true upon my honour
are not you astonished
mrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter
i hope he will be more agreeable now
she had never in her life been more astonished
captain benwick and louisa musgrove
happily for her they were not many
he is thought to be gouty
gout and decrepitude
poor old gentleman
have they any acquaintance here
we had better leave the crofts to find their own level
the crofts will associate with them
in her own room she tried to comprehend it
well might charles wonder how captain wentworth would feel
captain benwick and louisa musgrove
their minds most dissimilar
where could have been the attraction
the answer soon presented itself
it had been in situation
he had an affectionate heart
he must love somebody
she saw no reason against their being happy
she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate
they were too much like joy senseless joy
they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together
anne saw them wherever she went
thank you thank you
this is treating me like a friend
here i am you see staring at a picture
i can never get by this shop without stopping
but what a thing here is by way of a boat
did you ever see the like
i wonder where that boat was built
can i go anywhere for you or with you
can i be of any use
i am going home
what a boat it is
yes i have presently
as we pass however
i shall not stop
brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife
she poor soul is tied by the leg
shabby fellows both of them
i am glad they are not on this side of the way
sophy cannot bear them
i will tell you the whole story another time
there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson
the peace has come too soon for that younker
poor old sir archibald
how do you like bath miss elliot
it suits us very well
as soon as they were fairly ascending belmont he began
well now you shall hear something that will surprise you
the miss musgrove that all this has been happening to
her christian name i always forget her christian name
he was courting her week after week
we have seen nothing of him since november
even sophy could not understand it
you know james benwick
i am a little acquainted with captain benwick
well she is to marry him
there is something about frederick more to our taste
and the thing is certainly true
it is not a mere bit of gossip
we have it from frederick himself
i fancy they are all at uppercross
anne looked down to hide her smile
yes yes i understand you
but there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter
said he at last
now he must begin all over again with somebody else
i think we must get him to bath
sophy must write and beg him to come to bath
here are pretty girls enough i am sure
mr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay
they were in milsom street
there could be no doubt as to miss elliot
why was she to suspect herself of another motive
captain wentworth must be out of sight
she would see if it rained
still however she had enough to feel
he spoke to her and then turned away
the character of his manner was embarrassment
time had changed him or louisa had changed him
there was consciousness of some sort or other
the carriage would not accommodate so many
i walk i prefer walking
very little nothing that i regard
he will be here in a moment i am sure
she had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in
captain wentworth recollected him perfectly
being all that she had time for as she passed away
mr elliot does not dislike his cousin i fancy
no that is clear enough
one can guess what will happen there
what a very good looking man
but the men are all wild after miss elliot
anne is too delicate for them
but just now she could think only of captain wentworth
she hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas
she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet
he might be only passing through
but it was more probable that he should be come to stay
would she recollect him
how would it all be
at last lady russell drew back her head
now how would she speak of him
a day or two passed without producing anything
of course they must attend
mrs smith gave a most good humoured acquiescence
who is your party
anne named them all
i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme
she assured him that she had not
certainly i could have none
there are on both sides good principles and good temper
after clearing his throat however he proceeded thus
but i have no reason to suppose it so
a man like him in his situation
with a heart pierced wounded almost broken
he ought not he does not
you were a good while at lyme i think
about a fortnight
it had been my doing solely mine
she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak
the country round lyme is very fine
so much novelty and beauty
she was divided from captain wentworth
she was in good humour with all
but they should meet again
she was in need of a little interval for recollection
anne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room
her happiness was from within
yes some share of the tenderness of the past
she could not contemplate the change as implying less
he must love her
they had a concert bill between them
i am a very poor italian scholar
yes yes i see you are
i see you know nothing of the matter
you need not say anything more of your ignorance
here is complete proof
this is too much flattery
i knew you by report long before you came to bath
i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately
i have been acquainted with you by character many years
mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise
no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery
she wondered and questioned him eagerly but in vain
he delighted in being asked but he would not tell
her father and lady dalrymple were speaking
a very fine young man indeed
more air than one often sees in bath
irish i dare say
no i just know his name
wentworth captain wentworth of the navy
it had that appearance
when she could give another glance he had moved away
she had no longer any inclination to talk to him
she wished him not so near her
the first act was over
anne was one of the few who did not choose to move
he did not come however
the anxious interval wore away unproductively
she saw him not far off
she felt that something must be the matter
the change was indubitable
she thought of her father of lady russell
could there have been any unpleasant glances
it came from mr elliot
is not this song worth staying for
jealousy of mr elliot
it was the only intelligible motive
captain wentworth jealous of her affection
could she have believed it a week ago three hours ago
for a moment the gratification was exquisite
there were very different thoughts to succeed
how was such jealousy to be quieted
how was the truth to reach him
their evil was incalculable
she felt a great deal of good will towards him
it was altogether very extraordinary flattering but painful
there was much to regret
it was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way
they never miss a concert
the ibbotsons were they there
i do not think they were
old lady mary maclean
i need not ask after her
no that was what i dreaded
it would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect
you saw enough for your own amusement
no no you were better employed
you need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening
i see it in your eye
in the intervals of the concert it was conversation
she could say nothing
anne heard nothing of this
after another short silence
does he know that i am in bath
repeated anne looking up surprised
it is a great while since we met
i was not at all aware of this
you never mentioned it before
i want you to talk about me to mr elliot
i want your interest with him
i am not going to marry mr elliot
i should like to know why you imagine i am
now how i do wish i understood you
how i do wish i knew what you were at
but why should you be cruel
where can you look for a more suitable match
where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man
let me recommend mr elliot
ninety nine out of a hundred would do the same
of course he cannot be aware of the importance to me
mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman
your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been
i consider him with great respect
surely this must be calm enough
and upon my word he is nothing to me
i assure you i shall not
do tell me how it first came into your head
but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago
and has it indeed been spoken of
was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid
i observed no one in particular
the whole history repeated anne laughing
mrs smith said nothing
shall i mention to him your being in bath
shall i take any message
no i thank you no certainly not
i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years
not before he was married i suppose
yes he was not married when i knew him first
and were you much acquainted
then do tell me what he was at that time of life
was he at all such as he appears now
they were both silent mrs smith very thoughtful
there were many things to be taken into the account
hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced
he has no feeling for others
he is black at heart hollow and black
my expressions startle you
you must allow for an injured angry woman
but i will try to command myself
i will not abuse him
i will only tell you what i have found him
the intimacy had been formed before our marriage
we were principally in town living in very good style
it seemed to announce a different sort of man
i have always understood they were not a happy couple
why did mr elliot draw back
he was determined to make it by marriage
that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you
he told me the whole story
he had no concealments with me
to be sure i did very often
she checked herself just in time
this explains it
i found he had been used to hear of me
i could not comprehend how
what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned
how sure to be mistaken
but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you
mr elliot married then completely for money
mrs smith hesitated a little here
those things are too common
we lived for enjoyment
to do the best for himself passed as a duty
but was not she a very low woman
money money was all that he wanted
this was the letter directed to charles smith esq
dear smith i have received yours
your kindness almost overpowers me
he is worse than last year
i wish i had any name but elliot
i am sick of it
the name of walter i can drop thank god
the language i know is highly disrespectful
but it shows you the man
mark his professions to my poor husband
can any thing be stronger
but why be acquainted with us now
i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling
can you really
he is no hypocrite now
he truly wants to marry you
i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis
you are acquainted with him
my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient
this will not do
that was all prior to my coming to bath
i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived
only give me a hearing
nobody supposes that you were his first inducement
so says my historian at least
he certainly did
so far it is very true
i happened to be at lyme
he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william
there is always something offensive in the details of cunning
i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared
lessening i understand replied mrs smith
my line of conduct will be more direct
but mr elliot was not done with
but there was nobody to stir in it
this was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means
she had seemed to recommend and praise him
he was very unkind to his first wife
they were wretched together
i was willing to hope that you must fare better
anne went home to think over all that she had heard
there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him
pity for him was all over
but this was the only point of relief
she was most thankful for her own knowledge of him
could the knowledge have been extended through her family
but this was a vain idea
indeed i do say it
i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation
they appear to so much advantage in company with each other
each behaving so pleasantly
mr elliot looking up with so much respect
exactly like father and son
dear miss elliot may i not say father and son
if you will have such ideas
my dear miss elliot
i did invite him you know
i sent him away with smiles
lady russell quite bores one with her new publications
something so formal and arrange in her air
and she sits so upright
my best love of course
and mine added sir walter
make a civil message but i shall only leave my card
while her father spoke there was a knock at the door
who could it be
they had arrived late the night before
she never did you know
i cannot make her attend to the value of the property
they do everything to confer happiness i am sure
what a blessing to young people to be in such hands
i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now
anne could not help laughing
to be sure he is
he is a brave fellow
the visit passed off altogether in high good humour
elizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal
they have not seen two such drawing rooms before
they will be delighted to come to morrow evening
it shall be a regular party small but most elegant
a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected
he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation
i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now
they seemed deep in talk
come and tell me
it is mr elliot himself
you will be too late if you do not make haste
they are parting they are shaking hands
he is turning away
not know mr elliot indeed
you seem to have forgot all about lyme
a n t i a good boy
i have engaged captain wentworth
anne will not be sorry to join us i am sure
we all like a play
have not i done well mother
good heavens charles
how can you think of such a thing
take a box for to morrow night
how can you be so forgetful
no i did not promise
i only smirked and bowed and said the word happy
there was no promise
but you must go charles
it would be unpardonable to fail
we were asked on purpose to be introduced
there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves
nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately
every attention is due to mr elliot
what is mr elliot to me
we had better put it off
but it had better not be attempted perhaps
the usual character of them has nothing for me
i am no card player
you were not formerly i know
eight years and a half is a period
they were obliged to move
their preparations however were stopped short
how mortifying to feel that it was so
her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular
elizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure
the sequel explained it
the past was nothing
whispered mary very audibly
i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted
you see he cannot put the card out of his hand
i was never more astonished
he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard
she had promised to be with the musgroves from breakfast to dinner
there was no delay no waste of time
two minutes after her entering the room captain wentworth said
i always think that no mutual
it is what i always protested against for my children
anne found an unexpected interest here
she roused herself and went to him
certainly captain benwick
yes and you may guess who it is for
i little thought then but no matter
this was drawn at the cape
it was a commission to me
but who else was there to employ
i hope i can allow for him
she would not have forgotten him so soon
no replied anne in a low feeling voice
that i can easily believe
it was not in her nature
she doted on him
and she answered the question smiling also yes
we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us
it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit
we cannot help ourselves
you are forced on exertion
he has not been forced upon any exertion
i believe the reverse
your home country friends all quitted
have you finished your letter
not quite a few lines more
i shall have done in five minutes
there is no hurry on my side
i am only ready whenever you are
no hurry for a signal at all
no man and woman would probably
but perhaps you will say these were all written by men
perhaps i shall
men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story
i will not allow books to prove anything
but how shall we prove anything
we never shall
we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point
it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof
pressing his own with emotion
there is no quarrelling with you
and when i think of benwick my tongue is tied
their attention was called towards the others
mrs croft was taking leave
i know you will not be sorry to be off
i shall be at your service in half a minute
anne knew not how to understand it
she had the kindest good morning god bless you
he had passed out of the room without a look
anything was possible anything might be defied rather than suspense
i can listen no longer in silence
you pierce my soul
i am half agony half hope
i have loved none but you
you alone have brought me to bath
for you alone i think and plan
have you not seen this
can you fail to have understood my wishes
i can hardly write
i am every instant hearing something which overpowers me
too good too excellent creature
you do us justice indeed
you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men
such a letter was not to be soon recovered from
every moment rather brought fresh agitation
it was overpowering happiness
charles ring and order a chair
she must not walk
but the chair would never do
anxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said
captain harville has no thought but of going
do you think so
but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry
you will see them both this morning i dare say
to be sure i will if you wish it
but indeed my dear you need not be uneasy
it could not be very lasting however
another momentary vexation occurred
this was almost cruel
he walked by her side
presently struck by a sudden thought charles said
captain wentworth which way are you going
only to gay street or farther up the town
i hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised
are you going as high as belmont
are you going near camden place
there could not be an objection
she had not mistaken him
he persisted in having loved none but her
she had never been supplanted
he never even believed himself to see her equal
at lyme he had received lessons of more than one sort
from that period his penance had become severe
i was startled and shocked
i was hers in honour if she wished it
i had been unguarded
i had not thought seriously on this subject before
i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences
i could have no other pleasure
anne smiled and let it pass
it was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach
was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come
and to arrive with some degree of hope
that evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments
how could i look on without agony
you should have distinguished replied anne
i had no reason to believe her of less authority now
the force of habit was to be added
the wallises she had amusement in understanding them
to me she was in the place of a parent
do not mistake me however
i am not saying that she did not err in her advice
but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time
i trust to being in charity with her soon
would you in short have renewed the engagement then
was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough
he cried you would
i did not understand you
six years of separation and suffering might have been spared
i have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards
i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune
i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve
who can be in doubt of what followed
this however was what lady russell had now to do
there she felt her own inferiority very keenly
the family of dashwood had long been settled in sussex
his attachment to them all increased
he then really thought himself equal to it
it would be enough to make them completely easy
he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience
the resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great
they encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction
she begged him to think again on the subject
he could hardly suppose i should neglect them
the promise therefore was given and must be performed
your sisters will marry and it will be gone for ever
to be sure it would
they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them
a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable
my dear fanny her life cannot be worth half that purchase
you are not aware of what you are doing
my mother was quite sick of it
undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it
i would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly
it will certainly be much the best way
to be sure it will
their housekeeping will be nothing at all
only conceive how comfortable they will be
five hundred a year
they will be much more able to give you something
some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then
certainly returned mrs john dashwood
but however one thing must be considered
that is a material consideration undoubtedly
a valuable legacy indeed
but however so it is
your father thought only of them
this argument was irresistible
but mrs dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration
but edward had no turn for great men or barouches
fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising
it was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother
it implies everything amiable
i love him already
replied her mother with a smile
i feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love
you may esteem him
mrs dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him
her manners were attaching and soon banished his reserve
in a few months my dear marianne
we shall miss her but she will be happy
mamma how shall we do without her
my love it will be scarcely a separation
you will gain a brother a real affectionate brother
edward is very amiable and i love him tenderly
he admires as a lover not as a connoisseur
to satisfy me those characters must be united
i felt for my sister most severely
i could hardly keep my seat
i require so much
remember my love that you are not seventeen
why should you be less fortunate than your mother
no taste for drawing
replied elinor why should you think so
marianne hardly knew what to say
at length she replied
i think him every thing that is worthy and amiable
i do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly
marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased
you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth
what say you marianne
she felt that edward stood very high in her opinion
marianne here burst forth with indignation
cold hearted elinor
worse than cold hearted
ashamed of being otherwise
elinor could not help laughing
but farther than this you must not believe
i am by no means assured of his regard for me
but there are other points to be considered besides his inclination
he is very far from being independent
and you really are not engaged to him
yet it certainly soon will happen
but two advantages will proceed from this delay
elinor had given her real opinion to her sister
she needed no time for deliberation or inquiry
her resolution was formed as she read
they heard her with surprise
are you indeed going there
so far from hence
and to what part of it
she explained the situation
it was within four miles northward of exeter
dear dear norland
a narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind
it had not been built many years and was in good repair
the situation of the house was good
i could wish the stairs were handsome
sir john middleton was a good looking man about forty
barton park was about half a mile from the cottage
sir john was a sportsman lady middleton a mother
the miss dashwoods were young pretty and unaffected
he was silent and grave
mrs jennings was a widow with an ample jointure
she was perfectly convinced of it
it is too ridiculous
said elinor do you call colonel brandon infirm
did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism
and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life
mamma you are not doing me justice
he may live twenty years longer
but thirty five has nothing to do with matrimony
in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable
i am sure edward ferrars is not well
nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay
what else can detain him at norland
had you any idea of his coming so soon
said mrs dashwood
does elinor expect him already
how strange this is
what can be the meaning of it
but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable
how cold how composed were their last adieus
how languid their conversation the last evening of their being together
even now her self command is invariable
when is she dejected or melancholy
the dashwoods were now settled at barton with tolerable comfort to themselves
the whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks
he put down his gun and ran to her assistance
but this he declined as he was dirty and wet
mrs dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged
every circumstance belonging to him was interesting
cried sir john what is he in the country
you know him then said mrs dashwood
to be sure i do
why he is down here every year
and what sort of a young man is he
and is that all you can say for him
cried marianne indignantly
but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance
what his pursuits his talents and genius
sir john was rather puzzled
was she out with him today
where does he come from
has he a house at allenham
miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself
brandon will be jealous if she does not take care
it is not an employment to which they have been brought up
marianne was still handsomer
their taste was strikingly alike
you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic
elinor cried marianne is this fair
are my ideas so scanty
but i see what you mean
marianne was softened in a moment
he came to them every day
his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment
that is exactly what i think of him cried marianne
in defence of your protege you can even be saucy
yes marianne even in a man between thirty and forty
but why should you dislike him
i do not dislike him
but it will not do
you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful
yet such was the case
elinor could not be surprised at their attachment
when he was present she had no eyes for any one else
every thing he did was right
every thing he said was clever
this was the season of happiness to marianne
willoughby was out of the question
no replied elinor her opinions are all romantic
i believe she does
i cannot agree with you there said elinor
after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying
or is it equally criminal in every body
i speak from experience
elinor attempted no more
you shall share its use with me
this was too much
elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more
i shall keep it only till you can claim it
but indeed this is quite another thing
take care margaret
it may be only the hair of some great uncle of his
but indeed elinor it is marianne s
but the effort was painful
i must not tell ma am
he is the curate of the parish i dare say
no that he is not
he is of no profession at all
while they were at breakfast the letters were brought in
what is the matter with brandon
in about five minutes he returned
none at all ma am i thank you
was it from avignon
i hope it is not to say that your sister is worse
it came from town and is merely a letter of business
no indeed it is not
and i hope she is well
whom do you mean ma am
said he colouring a little
you know who i mean
cried mrs jennings
what a blow upon them all was this
he shook his head
i wish it could be so easily settled
i cannot afford to lose one hour
brandon is one of them
i would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing
i have no doubt of it replied marianne
but however i hope you will think better of it
well then when will you come back again
you are very obliging
he must and shall come back cried sir john
i suppose it is something he is ashamed of
you do not go to town on horseback do you
i shall then go post
but you had better change your mind
i assure you it is not in my power
he then took leave of the whole party
i am afraid none at all
to marianne he merely bowed and said nothing
said almost every body
yes it is about miss williams i am sure
and who is miss williams
do not you know who miss williams is
i am sure you must have heard of her before
i dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune
willoughby took his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods
i know where you spent the morning
marianne coloured and replied very hastily where pray
marianne turned away in great confusion
marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it
is not it what you have often wished to do yourself
i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life
it is a corner room and has windows on two sides
i could see it in his face
i am afraid his circumstances may be bad
i wonder whether it is so
i would give anything to know the truth of it
i would lay any wager it is about miss williams
i wonder what it can be
his setting off in such a hurry seems very like it
so wondered so talked mrs jennings
he exclaimed improve this dear cottage
that i will never consent to
i am heartily glad of it he cried
thank you willoughby
to me it is faultless
must it not have been so marianne
speaking to her in a lowered voice
you would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement
you are a good woman he warmly replied
your promise makes me easy
extend it a little farther and it will make me happy
shall we see you tomorrow to dinner
said mrs dashwood when he was leaving them
he engaged to be with them by four o clock
is anything the matter with her
cried mrs dashwood as she entered is she ill
to london and are you going this morning
almost this moment
this is very unfortunate
my visits to mrs smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth
and is mrs smith your only friend
for shame willoughby can you wait for an invitation here
mrs dashwood looked at elinor with surprise
elinor felt equal amazement
for a few moments every one was silent
mrs dashwood first spoke
he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room
she thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust
it is all very strange
so suddenly to be gone
it seems but the work of a moment
he did not speak he did not behave like himself
you must have seen the difference as well as i
what can it be
can they have quarrelled
he had not the power of accepting it
can you indeed
this is what i believe to have happened
and now elinor what have you to say
nothing for you have anticipated my answer
oh elinor how incomprehensible are your feelings
you had rather take evil upon credit than good
and after all what is it you suspect him of
i can hardly tell myself
but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us
concealing it from us
my dear child do you accuse willoughby and marianne of concealment
i am perfectly satisfied of both
i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly
have we not perfectly understood each other
my elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement
how could such a thought occur to you
how strange this is
do you suppose him really indifferent to her
no i cannot think that
he must and does love her i am sure
a mighty concession indeed
but i require no such proof
it must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect
is he not a man of honour and feeling
has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm
can he be deceitful
i hope not i believe not cried elinor
it has been involuntary and i will not encourage it
you speak very properly
willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected
this violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening
her sensibility was potent enough
the evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling
she read nothing but what they had been used to read together
no letter from willoughby came and none seemed expected by marianne
her mother was surprised and elinor again became uneasy
it would be the natural result of your affection for her
she used to be all unreserve and to you more especially
i would not ask such a question for the world
at any rate it would be most ungenerous
cried marianne with strong surprise
no nor many weeks
hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles
and was hastening to meet him when elinor cried out
indeed marianne i think you are mistaken
it is not willoughby
his air his coat his horse
i knew how soon he would come
they were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman
marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise
no he had been in devonshire a fortnight
have you been lately in sussex
i was at norland about a month ago
and how does dear dear norland look
the woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves
what feelings have they the season the air altogether inspired
now there is no one to regard them
but sometimes they are
look up to it and be tranquil if you can
look at those hills
did you ever see their equals
to the left is barton park amongst those woods and plantations
you may see the end of the house
said marianne to herself as she walked on
have you an agreeable neighbourhood here
are the middletons pleasant people
how can you be so unjust
her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder
but how is your fame to be established
i shall not attempt it
i cannot be forced into genius and eloquence
you have no ambition i well know
your wishes are all moderate
greatness will not make me so
strange that it would
what have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness
elinor for shame
your ideas are only more noble than mine
come what is your competence
two thousand a year
one is my wealth
i guessed how it would end
a family cannot well be maintained on a smaller
i am sure i am not extravagant in my demands
repeated edward but why must you have hunters
every body does not hunt
marianne coloured as she replied but most people do
oh that they would
cried margaret how happy i should be
i wonder what i should do with it
marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point
should not you marianne
forgive me if i am very saucy
at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed
she is only grown a little more grave than she was
you are not very gay yourself
why should you think so
replied he with a sigh
but gaiety never was a part of my character
this has always been your doctrine i am sure
no marianne never
my doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding
all i have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour
you must not confound my meaning
quite the contrary replied elinor looking expressively at marianne
edward started reserved
am i reserved marianne
i do not understand you replied he colouring
reserved how in what manner
what am i to tell you
what can you suppose
edward made no answer
elinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend
you must be satisfied with such admiration as i can honestly give
i know nothing of the picturesque
he is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own
i like a fine prospect but not on picturesque principles
i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees
i do not like ruined tattered cottages
i am not fond of nettles or thistles or heath blossoms
marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her sister
i remember her promising to give you some
but i should have thought her hair had been darker
the setting always casts a different shade on it you know
elinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise
he was particularly grave the whole morning
mrs jennings enforced the necessity
and that will tempt you miss marianne
who is to dance
and who is willoughby
she gave him a brief reply
shall i tell you my guess
what do you mean
shall i tell you
well then i guess that mr willoughby hunts
we never could agree in our choice of a profession
i always preferred the church as i still do
but that was not smart enough for my family
they recommended the army
that was a great deal too smart for me
in feeling in action in condition in every thing
know your own happiness
how much may not a few months do
she happened to be quite alone
how do you like them
they will hear you
never mind if they do
it is only the palmers
charlotte is very pretty i can tell you
you may see her if you look this way
where is marianne
has she run away because we are come
i see her instrument is open
she is walking i believe
how does mrs dashwood do
and where are your sisters
you will be glad of a little company to sit with you
i have brought my other son and daughter to see you
only think of their coming so suddenly
what a delightful room this is
i never saw anything so charming
i always thought it such a sweet place ma am
only look sister how delightful every thing is
how i should like such a house for myself
should not you mr
it is so ridiculous
here comes marianne cried sir john
now palmer you shall see a monstrous pretty girl
she got up to examine them
dear how beautiful these are
do but look mama how sweet
my love have you been asleep
said his wife laughing
he then made his bow and departed with the rest
why should they ask us
said marianne as soon as they were gone
we must look for the change elsewhere
i am so glad to see you
he is so droll
he never tells me any thing
they were obliged to put an end to such an expectation
not go to town
you must come indeed
they thanked her but were obliged to resist all her entreaties
how horrid all this is
such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting
dullness is as much produced within doors as without by rain
how few people know what comfort is
sir john is as stupid as the weather
the rest of the company soon dropt in
marianne looked very grave and said nothing
not above ten miles i dare say
much nearer thirty said her husband
there is not much difference
is it very ugly
why did not you ask the gilberts to come to us today
they dined with us last
do you know that you are quite rude
so there i have the whip hand of you
mr palmer is so droll
said she in a whisper to elinor
he is always out of humour
it was the desire of appearing superior to other people
will you come and spend some time at cleveland this christmas
you cannot think how happy i shall be
they both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation
but indeed you must and shall come
i am sure you will like it of all things
but poor fellow
it is very fatiguing to him
for he is forced to make every body like him
how i shall laugh
he declares he won t
mr palmer took no notice of her
don t palm all your abuses of languages upon me
there now you see how droll he is
this is always the way with him
certainly said elinor he seems very agreeable
well i am so glad you do
i assure you i heard of it in my way through town
you surprise me very much
colonel brandon tell you of it
surely you must be mistaken
is it true pray
and what did the colonel say
it will be quite delightful i declare
when is it to take place
mr brandon was very well i hope
i am flattered by his commendation
he seems an excellent man and i think him uncommonly pleasing
is mr willoughby much known in your part of somersetshire
you can t think how much i longed to see you
it is so delightful that you should live at the cottage
nothing can be like it to be sure
i hope you will be a great deal at combe magna
it is a sweet place by all accounts
sir john and lady middleton wished it very much
had he never owned his affection to yourself
however i am much happier as i am
mr palmer is the kind of man i like
benevolent philanthropic man
lucy is monstrous pretty and so good humoured and agreeable
you will be delighted with them i am sure
they have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children
how can you be so cross as not to come
why they are your cousins you know after a fashion
but sir john could not prevail
john is in such spirits today
poor little creatures
said miss steele as soon as they were gone
it might have been a very sad accident
what a sweet woman lady middleton is
she merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly
and what a charming little family they have
i suppose you were very sorry to leave sussex
norland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it
and had you a great many smart beaux there
but i can t bear to see them dirty and nasty
this specimen of the miss steeles was enough
how can you say so anne
elinor heard all this with attention and surprise
and who was this uncle
where did he live
how came they acquainted
i cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious
i am sorry you do not happen to know mrs
cried elinor what do you mean
are you acquainted with mr robert ferrars
what felt elinor at that moment
elinor for a few moments remained silent
we have been engaged these four years
elinor though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe it
our acquaintance however is of many years date
did you never hear him talk of mr
we cannot mean the same mr
we can mean no other cried lucy smiling
no considering our situation it was not strange
it puts him quite out of heart
she returned it almost instantly acknowledging the likeness
but i am determined to set for it the very first opportunity
you are quite in the right replied elinor calmly
they then proceeded a few paces in silence
i am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke
as she said this she looked directly at her companion
what would you do yourself
your own judgment must direct you
did you think he came directly from town
did not you think him sadly out of spirits
we did indeed particularly so when he first arrived
perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him
she was mortified shocked confounded
had edward been intentionally deceiving her
had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel
was his engagement to lucy an engagement of the heart
his affection was all her own
she could not be deceived in that
he certainly loved her
what a softener of the heart was this persuasion
how much could it not tempt her to forgive
they quitted it only with the removal of the tea things
they all rose up in preparation for a round game
lady middleton proposed a rubber of casino to the others
the remaining five were now to draw their cards
in a firm though cautious tone elinor thus began
i will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again
how could you suppose so
we must wait it may be for many years
elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion
lucy looked at elinor again and was silent
do you know mr robert ferrars
a great coxcomb
elinor blushed in spite of herself
lucy bit her lip and looked angrily at her sister
a mutual silence took place for some time
then i rather suspect that my interest would do very little
they were again silent for many minutes
at length lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh
but you will not give me your advice miss dashwood
shall you be in town this winter miss dashwood
said she with all her accustomary complacency
but i dare say you will go for all that
how unlucky that is
i had quite depended upon meeting you there
but i only go for the sake of seeing edward
no nothing should tempt me to leave her
it should not must not be a struggle
margaret and i shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves
you will find margaret so improved when you come back again
what formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward
do let me hear a word about the expense of it
mrs dashwood smiled and said nothing
their departure took place in the first week in january
the middletons were to follow in about a week
in a few moments marianne did the same
this decided the matter at once
is your sister ill
mrs jennings soon came in
how does charlotte do
i warrant you she is a fine size by this time
ay to be sure i thought as much
ay it is a fine thing to be young and handsome
he has been dead these eight years and better
but colonel where have you been to since we parted
and how does your business go on
marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks
wherever they went she was evidently always on the watch
said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels
she was answered in the negative
are you quite sure of it
the man replied that none had
how odd indeed
repeated elinor within herself regarding her sister with uneasiness
i long to inquire and how will my interference be borne
i had not thought of that
this weather will keep many sportsmen in the country
how much they must enjoy it
frosts will soon set in and in all probability with severity
mary always has her own way
there seems to me a very decided difference
i can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff
it was not so yesterday i think
she feared it was a strengthening regard
cried marianne he has been here while we were out
cried marianne stepping hastily forward
no ma am for my mistress
but marianne not convinced took it instantly up
it is indeed for mrs jennings how provoking
you are expecting a letter then
said elinor unable to be longer silent
yes a little not much
after a short pause
you have no confidence in me marianne
i thought you were both in devonshire said he
when do you go back again
and thus ended their discourse
she complained of it as they returned to berkeley street
marianne said no more but looked exceedingly hurt
how can that be
by whom can you have heard it mentioned
is every thing finally settled
is it impossible to
excuse me miss dashwood
why does he not look at me
why cannot i speak to him
perhaps he has not observed you yet
she sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature
but the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed
willoughby what is the meaning of this
have you not received my letters
will you not shake hands with me
during all this time he was evidently struggling for composure
elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil
my card was not lost i hope
but have you not received my notes
cried marianne in the wildest anxiety
here is some mistake i am sure some dreadful mistake
what can be the meaning of it
how can that be done
no my dearest marianne you must wait
this is not the place for explanations
wait only till tomorrow
scarcely a word was spoken during their return to berkeley street
nothing but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it
marianne may i ask
pray when are they to be married
for shame for shame miss dashwood
how can you talk so
come come this won t do
i tell every body of it and so does charlotte
bond street january
how unhappy i make you
elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence
but do not torture me so
do you call me happy marianne
many many circumstances said elinor solemnly
you can have no grief
and you will never see me otherwise
mine is a misery which nothing can do away
you must not talk so marianne
have you no comforts
is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation
cried marianne there has been no engagement
no he is not so unworthy as you believe him
he has broken no faith with me
but he told you that he loved you
yes no never absolutely
it was every day implied but never professedly declared
sometimes i thought it had been but it never was
yet you wrote to him
berkeley street january
at any rate i shall expect you to morrow
for the present adieu
but could it be so
the contents of her last note to him were these
again i demand an explanation of it
i was repulsed indeed
have you forgot the last evening of our being together at barton
the morning that we parted too
dearest marianne who but himself
by whom can he have been instigated
by all the world rather than by his own heart
it is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence
i care not who knows that i am wretched
i would do more than for my own
but to appear happy when i am so miserable oh
who can require it
again they were both silent
it is too much
oh willoughby willoughby could this be yours
cruel cruel nothing can acquit you
elinor nothing can
willoughby where was your heart when you wrote those words
oh barbarously insolent elinor can he be justified
no marianne in no possible way
elinor i must go home
i must go and comfort mama
can not we be gone to morrow
to morrow marianne
yes why should i stay here
it would be impossible to go to morrow
the middletons and palmers how am i to bear their pity
the pity of such a woman as lady middleton
oh what would he say to that
how do you do my dear
how is she miss dashwood poor thing
she looks very bad no wonder
ay it is but too true
i have no patience with him
well poor thing
elinor even advised her against it
and the dried cherries too
nothing seems to do her any good
they care no more about such things
fifty thousand pounds my dear
did you ever see her
a smart stylish girl they say but not handsome
but the family are all rich together
dashing about with his curricle and hunters
do you know what kind of a girl miss grey is
is she said to be amiable
and who are the ellisons
her guardians my dear
is there nothing one can get to comfort her
poor dear it seems quite cruel to let her be alone
what shall we play at
dear ma am this kindness is quite unnecessary
aye i believe that will be best for her
let her name her own supper and go to bed
and so the letter that came today finished it
but then you know how should i guess such a thing
but i shall see them tomorrow
yes that i do indeed
you saw i did not all dinner time
and what does talking ever do you know
don t pretend to defend him
no positive engagement indeed
he will have her at last aye that he will
how he ll chuckle over this news
i hope he will come tonight
it will be all to one a better match for your sister
how charlotte and i did stuff the only time we were there
tis a nice place
one shoulder of mutton you know drives another down
if we can but put willoughby out of her head
how fond he was of it
do take it to your sister
he knows nothing of it do tell him my dear
marianne is not well said she
what did you hear
yes we do know it all
mr willoughby is unfathomable
where did you hear it
but have you likewise heard that miss grey has fifty thousand pounds
her sufferings have been very severe
i have only to hope that they may be proportionately short
it has been it is a most cruel affliction
he has been very deceitful
said colonel brandon there is indeed
the work of one moment was destroyed by the next
willoughby filled every page
who can this be
i thought we had been safe
marianne moved to the window
it is colonel brandon
said she with vexation
we are never safe from him
i understand you said elinor
pray pray let me hear it
indeed answered elinor i have not forgotten it
he looked pleased by this remembrance and added
at seventeen she was lost to me for ever
she was married married against her inclination to my brother
her fortune was large and our family estate much encumbered
i have never told you how this was brought on
we were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland
this however was not the case
but to what does all this lead
i seem to have been distressing you for nothing
i will be more collected more concise
she loved the child and had always kept it with her
but last february almost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared
cried elinor could it be could willoughby
this is beyond every thing
surely this comparison must have its use with her
she will feel her own sufferings to be nothing
they proceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrace
yes he replied gravely once i have
one meeting was unavoidable
have you met him to
i could meet him no other way
and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust
is she still in town
sir john could not have thought it possible
such a good natured fellow
he did not believe there was a bolder rider in england
it was an unaccountable business
he wished him at the devil with all his heart
such a scoundrel of a fellow
such a deceitful dog
and this was the end of it
mrs palmer in her way was equally angry
elinor only was sorry to see them
but i always thought i should
i am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word
cried mrs jennings very pretty indeed
and the doctor is a single man i warrant you
my beau indeed
said i i cannot think who you mean
the doctor is no beau of mine
no i do not think we shall
oh yes i dare say you will
elinor would not humour her by farther opposition
long a time indeed
interposed mrs jennings
why their visit is but just begun
you are very good
oh dear that is a great pity
elinor with great civility declined the proposal
at last the affair was decided
elinor found that he and fanny had been in town two days
harry was vastly pleased
i am come here to bespeak fanny a seal
i understand she is a woman of very good fortune
and the middletons too you must introduce me to them
they are excellent neighbours to you in the country i understand
his visit was duly paid
the weather was remarkably fine and she readily consented
who is colonel brandon
is he a man of fortune
yes he has very good property in dorsetshire
i am glad of it
what do you mean
i observed him narrowly and am convinced of it
what is the amount of his fortune
i believe about two thousand a year
you are mistaken elinor you are very much mistaken
a very little trouble on your side secures him
it is a match that must give universal satisfaction
elinor would not vouchsafe any answer
and yet it is not very unlikely
he has a most excellent mother
the lady is the hon
more than you think it really and intrinsically worth
why i hope not that
elinor could only smile
where is the green house to be
upon the knoll behind the house
but she raises none in those most concerned
i am sorry for that
she will be mistaken however
abundance of civilities passed on all sides
lady middleton is really a most elegant woman
but now i can carry her a most satisfactory account of both
lady middleton was equally pleased with mrs dashwood
on elinor its effect was very different
pity me dear miss dashwood
the parties stood thus
but she does every thing well
dear dear elinor don t mind them
don t let them make you unhappy
jennings with a very intelligent ah
she was certainly very civil to you
you shan t talk me out of my satisfaction
i never was in better health
but it seemed to satisfy lucy for she directly replied
i could not have stood it
for where she does dislike i know it is most violent
the ladies recovered themselves first
oh don t think of me
elinor is well you see
that must be enough for us both
do you like london
i expected much pleasure in it but i have found none
you are what you always were
she paused no one spoke
i was engaged elsewhere
but what was that when such friends were to be met
edward it is so and i will say it
said marianne my dear edward this must not be
what can bring her here so often
said marianne on her leaving them
it was censure in common use and easily given
their presence was a restraint both on her and on lucy
an effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend
would they only have laughed at her about the doctor
the events of this evening were not very remarkable
he bestowed his hearty approbation however on their species of house
i was to decide on the best of them
and that i fancy will be the end of it
lady elliott wished to give a dance
but how can it be done
lady elliott was delighted with the thought
fanny was startled at the proposal
how can i ask them away from her
mr dashwood was convinced
this was enough to make lucy really and reasonably happy
my dear miss dashwood
have you heard the news
something so strange
so i looked at it directly and lord
that is exactly what i said my dear
says i is mrs dashwood ill
to have his love used so scornfully
i have no pity for either of them
but marianne for some time would give credit to neither
how long has this been known to you elinor
has he written to you
i have known it these four months
after a pause of wonder she exclaimed
four months have you known of this four months
marianne seemed much struck
four months and yet you loved him
now i can think and speak of it with little emotion
i have many things to support me
i acquit edward of essential misconduct
marianne was quite subdued
the tenderest caresses followed this confession
your sister he continued has suffered dreadfully
she was in hysterics all yesterday
but i would not alarm you too much
she has borne it all with the fortitude of an angel
and now to be so rewarded
she was quite in an agony
but i am sorry to relate what ensued
duty affection every thing was disregarded
i never thought edward so stubborn so unfeeling before
can this be possible
your exclamation is very natural
nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement
he would stand to it cost him what it might
he therefore replied without any resentment
it has been dignified and liberal
poor young man and what is to become of him
what indeed ma am
it is a melancholy consideration
born to the prospect of such affluence
i cannot conceive a situation more deplorable
poor young man
said mrs jennings that is her revenge
everybody has a way of their own
marianne got up and walked about the room
i feel for him sincerely
mrs jennings immediately whispered to elinor
get it all out of her my dear
she will tell you any thing if you ask
you see i cannot leave mrs
not at all i believe with you
that is a good thing
and lady middleton is she angry
i cannot suppose it possible that she should
i am monstrous glad of it
i have had such a time of it
i never saw lucy in such a rage in my life
there now you are going to laugh at me too
but why should not i wear pink ribbons
my cousins have been so plaguing me
oh did not you
i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be
no indeed not us
how could you behave so unfairly by your sister
there is nothing in that
i only stood at the door and heard what i could
and your brother and sister were not very kind
i wonder what curacy he will get good gracious
i write to the doctor indeed
you have got your answer ready
here come the richardsons
i assure you they are very genteel people
good by i am sorry miss marianne was not here
remember me kindly to her
and lord help em
it was as follows
that was just like lucy poor soul
that sentence is very prettily turned
she cried with great agitation
no i cannot go to cleveland
this set the matter beyond a doubt
i am afraid it cannot take place very soon
what should hinder it
but checking her desire confined herself to this silent ejaculation
i shall always think myself very much obliged to you
what had really passed between them was to this effect
elinor told him that it was
i understand that he intends to take orders
pray assure him of it
thank you ma am said elinor
there are not many men who would act as he has done
few people who have so compassionate a heart
i never was more astonished in my life
my dear you are very modest
repeated mrs jennings oh
aye my dear that i do indeed
he spoke of its being out of repair
well and whose fault is that
marianne had left the room before the conversation began
very well said mrs jennings rather disappointed
i shall do that directly
this speech at first puzzled mrs jennings exceedingly
oh ho i understand you
mr ferrars is to be the man
well so much the better for him
but my dear is not this rather out of character
and so you are forced to do it
well that is an odd kind of delicacy
you know your own concerns best
so goodby my dear
and away she went but returning again in a moment
i should be very glad to get her so good a mistress
however you will think of all that at your leisure
her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance
i go to oxford tomorrow
mrs jennings was quite right in what she said
colonel brandon give me a living can it be possible
you are very much mistaken
i have had no hand in it
colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability
elinor told him the number of the house
no ma am that was not very likely
two or three months
cried mrs jennings lord
elinor made what excuse she could for her
about two hundred a year
it is truly astonishing
a very simple one to be of use to mr
mrs ferrars can never forget that edward is her son
you wrong her exceedingly
choice how do you mean
not that you have any reason to regret my dear elinor
has colonel brandon been with you lately
he laughed most immoderately
he is ruined for ever
my poor mother was half frantic
have you ever seen the lady
but now it is all too late
their journey was safely performed
their party was small and the hours passed quietly away
is mama coming
i shall never see her if she goes by london
it was lower and quicker than ever
it was no time for hesitation
her fears and her difficulties were immediately before him
elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome
not a moment was lost in delay of any kind
it was a night of almost equal suffering to both
her heart was really grieved
but it was too late
others even arose to confirm it
elinor could not be cheerful
the night was cold and stormy
the clock struck eight
she instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her
the flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view
your business cannot be with me
my business is with you and only you
sit down and i will be both
she hesitated she knew not what to do
i heard it from the servant
god be praised but is it true
is it really true
elinor would not speak
he repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness
we hope she is
he rose up and walked across the room
elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever
is this the real reason of your coming
elinor bowed her assent
could it be an impartial one
i wish i heartily wish it had never been
was scarcely less warm than hers and whose mind oh
well sir and what said mrs
in short it ended in a total breach
by one measure i might have saved myself
in the height of her morality good woman
she offered to forgive the past if i would marry eliza
the struggle was great but it ended too soon
why did you call mr
it was necessary to my own pride
you were all gone i do not know where
they were both silent for a few moments
did you tell her that you should soon return
it did torture me
yes i saw every note that passed
this is not right mr
willoughby remember that you are married
but this note made me know myself better
but every thing was then just settled between miss grey and me
to retreat was impossible
all that i had to do was to avoid you both
watched us out of the house
i could not answer it
i tried but could not frame a sentence
a short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded
willoughby first rousing himself broke it thus
well let me make haste and be gone
your sister is certainly better certainly out of danger
we are assured of it
your poor mother too doting on marianne
yes yes that in particular
you saw what she said
she was well paid for her impudence
she read what made her wretched
you had made your own choice
it was not forced on you
have i explained away any part of my guilt
you have proved your heart less wicked much less wicked
you tell me that she has forgiven me already
now you know all
elinor made no answer
are you going back to town
no to combe magna
he held out his hand
and you do think something better of me than you did
his answer was not very encouraging
domestic happiness is out of the question
marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever
were i even by any blessed chance at liberty again
elinor stopped him with a reproof
well he replied once more good bye
i shall now go away and live in dread of one event
what do you mean
you are very wrong
she can never be more lost to you than she is now
but she will be gained by some one else
good bye god bless you
and with these words he almost ran out of the room
but her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful
at last we are alone
my elinor you do not yet know all my happiness
colonel brandon loves marianne
he has told me so himself
he opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled
it came out quite unawares quite undesignedly
marianne might at that moment be dying
but he did not ask for hope or encouragement
there however he is quite mistaken
to elinor the observation of the latter was particularly grateful
after dinner she would try her piano forte
the next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms
i know we shall be happy
i know the summer will pass happily away
but the resolution was made only to be broken
her voice sunk with the word but presently reviving she added
elinor tenderly invited her to be open
elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered
elinor said no more
he will suffer enough in them
do you compare your conduct with his
our situations have borne little resemblance
had i died it would have been self destruction
every body seemed injured by me
marianne pressed her hand and replied
you are very good the future must be my proof
they shall no longer worry others nor torture myself
i shall now live solely for my family
his remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions
nothing could have done it away to my feelings
i know it i know it cried her mother
marianne sighed and repeated i wish for no change
had you married you must have been always poor
in a tone that implied do you really think him selfish
it is very true
my happiness never was his object
it has not made him happy
elinor grew impatient for some tidings of edward
who told you that mr ferrars was married thomas
but did she tell you she was married thomas
so i made free to wish her joy
was mr ferrars in the carriage with her
was there no one else in the carriage
no ma am only they two
do you know where they came from
and are they going farther westward
yes ma am but not to bide long
elinor looked as if she wished to hear more
did you see them off before you came away
did mrs ferrars look well
they were all thoughtless or indolent
when do you write to colonel brandon ma am
this was gaining something something to look forward to
colonel brandon must have some information to give
he stopt at their gate
it was a gentleman it was colonel brandon himself
were it possible she must say it must be edward
she moved away and sat down
i will be calm i will be mistress of myself
not a syllable passed aloud
they all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor
he coloured and stammered out an unintelligible reply
in a hurried manner he replied in the affirmative
is mrs ferrars at longstaple
mrs robert ferrars
elinor could sit it no longer
his errand at barton in fact was a simple one
his situation indeed was more than commonly joyful
marianne could speak her happiness only by tears
she repeated it to edward
other designs might afterward arise
elinor read and returned it without any comment
and your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment
she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a living
elinor smiled and shook her head
poor mr edward
a letter of proper submission
he agreed that he might
her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating
what immediately followed is known
it was now her darling object
marianne dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate
he lived to exert and frequently to enjoy himself
enter flauius murellus and certaine commoners ouer the stage
